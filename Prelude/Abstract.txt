From the discovery of H-mode by ASDEX in 1982, the mechanisms that cause the transition into this new operating regime have become an important topic of interest in fusion.
This transition is a bifurcation in the anomalous transport just inside the separatrix in a divertor tokamak.
It has been found that a key mechanism is the generation of a large radial electric field and corresponding $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow and flow shear near the plasma edge, suppressing transport.

This electric field at the edge can be found by investigating the nonambipolar fluxes that generate a radial current.
Several of these electric field-generating terms have been proposed, each with different scalings; therefore, it is plausible that global H-mode scalings are obscured by a shift in dominance of terms.
Using a set of nonlinear partial differential equations with boundary conditions, the relative strengths of field-generating effects can be determined for a particular set of tokamak parameters.
Time permitting, by varying parameters that scale with machine size, it could be found how each term theoretically scales, and how this affects extrapolation.
This investigation will aid in determining which measurable and controllable values can predict H-mode.
