	abstract = {The L to H mode transition occurs at a critical power which depends on various parameters, such as the magnetic field, the density, etc. Experimental evidence on various tokamaks (JET, ASDEX-Upgrade, DIII-D, Alcator C-Mod) points towards the existence of a critical temperature characterizing the transition. This criterion for the L--H transition is local and is therefore easier to be compared to theoretical approaches. In order to shed light on the mechanisms of the transition, simple theoretical ideas are used to derive a temperature threshold ( T th ). They are based on the stabilization of the underlying turbulence by a mean radial electric field shear. The nature of the turbulence varies as the collisionality decreases, from resistive ballooning modes to ion temperature gradient and trapped electron modes. The obtained parametric dependencies of the derived T th are tested versus magnetic field, density, effective charge. Various robust experimental observations are reproduced, in particular T th increases with magnetic field B and increases with density below the density roll-over observed on the power threshold.},

The properties and dependences of the power threshold in individual devices are reviewed. In particular, the analysis shows a rather general linear dependence on magnetic field, but a non-monotonic density dependence that varies from device to device. Investigation of the combined database suggests that the threshold dependence P\_thres approximately = 0.3 n\_e B\_T R{\textasciicircum}2.5 shows reasonable agreement with the data. This expression yields P\_thres approximately = 150 MW at a density of 0.5*10{\textasciicircum}20 m{\textasciicircum}-3 for ITER. Other expressions with weaker size dependence, and therefore lower threshold power for ITER, are also discussed. Their agreement with the present data is poorer than that of the above expression. In addition, the database is investigated by statistical discriminant analysis. The edge data included at present are described and discussed. Finally, there is a discussion of the implications of the results for ITER},

However, restricting the database to a more homogeneous subset of medium and large size tokamaks with single-null elongated plasma shapes yields expressions with much lower scatter. In this case the contribution from the experimental scatter in the individual machines plays a role. These regressions are stable against excluding one tokamak in turn.},

(codimension-2) Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations in three parameters using
subspace reduction techniques. During the continuation of
(codimension-2) Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations in 3 parameters,
generically degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations of codimension-3 are
detected. However, when these techniques are applied to the transport
model, we detect a degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension
4. The nearby 1- and 2-parameter slices are in agreement with the
presence of this codimension-4 degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation,
and all three types of L--H transitions can be recognized in these
slices. The same codimension-4 situation is observed under variation of
the additional parameters in the model, and under some modifications of
the model.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis of stabilization of turbulence by shear in the ExB drift speed successfully predicts the observed turbulence reduction and confinement improvement seen at the L (low)–H (high) transition; in addition, the observed levels of ExB shear significantly exceed the value theoretically required to stabilize turbulence. Furthermore, this same hypothesis is the best explanation to date for the further confinement improvement seen in the plasma core when the plasma goes from the H mode to the VH (very high) mode. Consequently, the most fundamental question for H‐mode studies now is: How is the electric field E\_r formed? The radial force balance equation relates E\_r to the main ion pressure gradient ∇P\_i, poloidal rotation v\_θi, and toroidal rotation v\_φi. In the plasma edge, observations show ∇P\_i and v\_θi are the important terms at the L–H transition, with ∇P\_i being the dominant, negative term throughout most of the H mode. In the plasma core, E\_r is primarily related to v\_φi. There is a clear temporal and spatial correlation between the change in ExB shear and the region of local confinement improvement when the plasma goes from the H mode to the VH mode. Direct manipulation of the v\_φi and ExB shear using the drag produced by a nonaxisymmetric magnetic perturbation has produced clear changes in local transport, consistent with the ExB shear stabilization hypothesis. The implications of these results for theories of the L–H and H–VH transitions will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Many effects influence toroidal flow evolution in tokamak plasmas. Momentum sources and radial plasma transport due to collisional processes and microturbulence-induced anomalous transport are usually considered. In addition, toroidal flow can be affected by nonaxisymmetric magnetic fields; resonant components cause localized electromagnetic toroidal torques near rational surfaces in flowing plasmas and nonresonant components induce "global" toroidal flow damping torque throughout the plasma. Also, poloidal magnetic field transients on the magnetic field diffusion time scale can influence plasma transport. Many of these processes can also produce momentum pinch and intrinsic flow effects. This paper presents a comprehensive and self-consistent description of all these effects within a fluid moment context. Plasma processes on successive time scales (and constraints they impose) are considered sequentially: compressional Alfvén waves (Grad–Shafranov equilibrium and ion radial force balance), sound waves (pressure constant along a field line and incompressible flows within a flux surface), and ion collisions (damping of poloidal flow). Finally, plasma transport across magnetic flux surfaces is induced by the many second order (in the small gyroradius expansion) toroidal torque effects indicated above. Nonambipolar components of the induced particle transport fluxes produce radial plasma currents. Setting the flux surface average of the net radial current induced by all these effects to zero yields the transport-time-scale equation for evolution of the plasma toroidal flow. It includes a combination of global toroidal flow damping and resonant torques induced by nonaxisymmetric magnetic field components, poloidal magnetic field transients, and momentum source effects, as well as the usual collision- and microturbulence-induced transport. On the transport time scale, the plasma toroidal rotation determines the radial electric field for net ambipolar particle transport. The ultimate radial particle transport is composed of intrinsically ambipolar fluxes plus nonambipolar fluxes evaluated at this toroidal-rotation-determined radial electric field.},

Stationary operation with type III ELMs imposes an upper limit on the edge temperature. Within the entire range of boundary densities investigated, both L--mode and H--mode are found to be accessible. During type I ELMy H--mode, a relation of global confinement with the edge pressure gradient is found which is connected with a loss of the favourable density dependence predicted by the ITER-92P and ITER-93H ELMy H--mode scalings.

	abstract = {The mechanism for formation of a steep structure in the radial electric field is a key issue in plasma confinement. Properties of the radial electric field bifurcation are studied taking into account the effect of electrode biasing. The radial electric field structure is determined by the charge conservation equation. From the nonlinear mechanism associated with local current due to ion bulk viscosity, a transition can take place. Various types of radial electric field structures with multiple peaks are allowed for the same boundary condition. The ion orbit loss term breaks the symmetry of the radial current similarly to the ambipolar radial electric field. A radial current driven by the electrode plays the role of a control parameter in a transition similarly to the pressure gradient. A phase diagram is given in the spontaneous drive vs external drive space. Differences in the radial shape of solitary electric field structures are demonstrated in the presence of spatial varying components. This study clarifies the mechanisms of nonlinear structure formation in transport barriers.},

	abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of the low(L) -{\textgreater} high(H) transition using a time-dependent, one dimensional (in radius) model which self-consistently describes the time evolution of zonal flows (ZFs), mean flows (MFs), poloidal spin-up, and density and pressure profiles. The model represents the physics of ZF and MF competition, turbulence suppression via ExB shearing, and poloidal flows driven by turbulence. Numerical solutions of this model show that the L -{\textgreater} H transition can occur via an intermediate phase (I-phase) which involves oscillations of profiles due to ZF and MF competition. The I-phase appears as a nonlinear transition wave originating at the edge boundary and propagates inward. Locally, I-phase exhibits the characteristics of a limit-cycle oscillation. All these observations are consistent with recent experimental results. We examine the trigger of the L -{\textgreater} H transition, by defining a ratio of the rate of energy transfer from the turbulence to the zonal flow to the rate of energy input into the turbulence. When the ratio exceeds order unity, ZF shear gains energy, and a net decay of the turbulence is possible, thus triggering the L -{\textgreater} H transition. Numerical calculations indicate that the L -{\textgreater} H transition is triggered by this peak of the normalized ZF shearing. Zonal flows act as “reservoir,” in which to store increasing fluctuation energy without increasing transport, thus allowing the mean flow shear to increase and lock in the transition. A counterpart of the L -{\textgreater} I -{\textgreater} H transition, i.e., an L -{\textgreater} H transition without I-phase, is obtained in a fast power ramp, for which I-phase is compressed into a single burst of ZF, which triggers the transition. Effects of neutral charge exchange on the L -{\textgreater} H transition are studied by varying ZF damping and neoclassical viscosity. Results show that the predicted L -{\textgreater} H transition power increases when either ZF damping or viscosity increase, suggesting a link between recycling, ZF damping, and the L -{\textgreater} H threshold. Studies of fueling effects on the transition and pedestal structure with an emphasis on the particle pinch are reported.},

Bifurcation theory can be used to compare these different models based on their dynamical transition structure. In this paper, we employ bifurcation theory to distinguish two fundamentally different descriptions of the interaction between turbulence levels and sheared flows. The analytic bifurcation analysis characterises the parameter space structure of the transition dynamics. Herewith, in these models three dynamically different types of transitions are characterised, sharp transitions, oscillatory transitions, and smooth transitions. One of the two models has a very robust transition structure and is therefore likely to be more accurate for such a robust phenomenon as the L--H transition. The other model needs more fine-tuning to get non-oscillatory transitions. These conclusions from the analytic bifurcation analysis are confirmed by dedicated numerical simulations, with the newly developed code Bifurcator.},

The scaling for the L--H transition threshold agrees with the experimental H--mode scaling of ASDEX Upgrade. The radial electric field shows no bifurcation and is close to the neoclassical electric field with the toroidal rotation contribution determined by the radial anomalous transport of the toroidal momentum.

The author then examines types of plasma waves and the issue of Landau damping. Magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium and stability are tackled with emphasis on the topological concepts of magnetic helicity and self-organization. Advanced topics follow, including magnetic reconnection, nonlinear waves, and the Fokker–Planck treatment of collisions. The book concludes by discussing unconventional plasmas such as non-neutral and dusty plasmas.

Four mechanisms for bipolar losses, i.e. the loss cone loss, the bulk viscosity loss, the charge-exchange (CX) loss between ions and neutrals and the anomalous loss, occur simultaneously in high-temperature plasmas. Neutral particles near the X-point are found to trigger the H--mode transition. They cause an additional ion loss cone loss via collisions. The lower limit of the neutral density near the X-point for the onset of the H--mode transition is estimated. Neutral particles at the main plasma are shown to prevent the H--mode transition because of CX loss.}

  abstract={In divertor tokamak plasmas with intense additional heating a large fraction of the power deposited at the target has been attributed to the collisionless losses of energetic ions from a region of about twice an ion poloidal Larmor radius inside the plasma boundary. These energetic ion losses can also strongly effect the formation of the radial electric field at the plasma edge, and may be responsible for the L to H transition. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of loss ion orbits at the tokamak edge. A particle following code has been developed to assess the detailed shape of the loss cone of escaping ions in velocity space, its transformation in the presence of a radial electric field, the shape of the loss orbits and the effect of the reversal of the toroidal magnetic field. The results obtained allow one to calculate the total amount of direct ion losses, which is expected to be substantially less than that estimated from the simplified assumptions used, because of the narrowness of the loss cone. The complex response of the ion loss cone to changes in radial electric field can potentially create a condition of instability (like the L to H transition) with rapid growth of the negative potential inside the plasma boundary. Numerical simulations have shown a relatively weak dependence of the energetic ion behaviour on the exact profile of the potential, suggesting that the resonant effects of the ion interaction with the magnetic field, expected from the theory of an idealized large aspect ratio tokamak (r/R<<1) and leading, for instance, to the effect of banana orbit squeezing, may not exist.}
