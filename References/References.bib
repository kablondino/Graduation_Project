It provides an introduction to nuclear fusion and its status and prospects, and features specialised chapters written by leaders in the field, presenting the main research and development concepts in fusion physics. It starts with an introduction to the case for the development of fusion as an energy source. Magnetic and inertial confinement are addressed. Dedicated chapters focus on the physics of confinement, the equilibrium and stability of tokamaks, diagnostics, heating and current drive by neutral beam and radiofrequency waves, and plasma-wall interactions. While the tokamak is a leading concept for the realisation of fusion, other concepts (helical confinement and, in a broader sense, other magnetic and inertial configurations) are also addressed in the book. At over 1100 pages, this publication provides an unparalleled resource for fusion physicists and engineers.},

More thorough than previous texts, it exploits new powerful mathematical techniques to develop deeper insights into plasma behavior. After developing the basic plasma equations from first principles, the book explores single particle motion with particular attention to adiabatic invariance. The author then examines types of plasma waves and the issue of Landau damping. Magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium and stability are tackled with emphasis on the topological concepts of magnetic helicity and self-organization. Advanced topics follow, including magnetic reconnection, nonlinear waves, and the Fokker–Planck treatment of collisions. The book concludes by discussing unconventional plasmas such as non-neutral and dusty plasmas. Written for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates, this text emphasizes the fundamental principles that apply across many different contexts.},

This criterion for the L--H transition is local and is therefore easier to be compared to theoretical approaches. In order to shed light on the mechanisms of the transition, simple theoretical ideas are used to derive a temperature threshold ( T th ). They are based on the stabilization of the underlying turbulence by a mean radial electric field shear. The nature of the turbulence varies as the collisionality decreases, from resistive ballooning modes to ion temperature gradient and trapped electron modes. The obtained parametric dependencies of the derived T th are tested versus magnetic field, density, effective charge. Various robust experimental observations are reproduced, in particular T th increases with magnetic field B and increases with density below the density roll-over observed on the power threshold.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis of stabilization of turbulence by shear in the ExB drift speed successfully predicts the observed turbulence reduction and confinement improvement seen at the L (low)–H (high) transition; in addition, the observed levels of ExB shear significantly exceed the value theoretically required to stabilize turbulence. Furthermore, this same hypothesis is the best explanation to date for the further confinement improvement seen in the plasma core when the plasma goes from the H mode to the VH (very high) mode. Consequently, the most fundamental question for H‐mode studies now is: How is the electric field E\_r formed? The radial force balance equation relates E\_r to the main ion pressure gradient ∇P\_i, poloidal rotation v\_θi, and toroidal rotation v\_φi. In the plasma edge, observations show ∇P\_i and v\_θi are the important terms at the L–H transition, with ∇P\_i being the dominant, negative term throughout most of the H mode. In the plasma core, E\_r is primarily related to v\_φi. There is a clear temporal and spatial correlation between the change in ExB shear and the region of local confinement improvement when the plasma goes from the H mode to the VH mode. Direct manipulation of the v\_φi and ExB shear using the drag produced by a nonaxisymmetric magnetic perturbation has produced clear changes in local transport, consistent with the ExB shear stabilization hypothesis. The implications of these results for theories of the L–H and H–VH transitions will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Many effects influence toroidal flow evolution in tokamak plasmas. Momentum sources and radial plasma transport due to collisional processes and microturbulence-induced anomalous transport are usually considered. In addition, toroidal flow can be affected by nonaxisymmetric magnetic fields; resonant components cause localized electromagnetic toroidal torques near rational surfaces in flowing plasmas and nonresonant components induce "global" toroidal flow damping torque throughout the plasma. Also, poloidal magnetic field transients on the magnetic field diffusion time scale can influence plasma transport. Many of these processes can also produce momentum pinch and intrinsic flow effects. This paper presents a comprehensive and self-consistent description of all these effects within a fluid moment context. Plasma processes on successive time scales (and constraints they impose) are considered sequentially: compressional Alfvén waves (Grad–Shafranov equilibrium and ion radial force balance), sound waves (pressure constant along a field line and incompressible flows within a flux surface), and ion collisions (damping of poloidal flow). Finally, plasma transport across magnetic flux surfaces is induced by the many second order (in the small gyroradius expansion) toroidal torque effects indicated above. Nonambipolar components of the induced particle transport fluxes produce radial plasma currents. Setting the flux surface average of the net radial current induced by all these effects to zero yields the transport-time-scale equation for evolution of the plasma toroidal flow. It includes a combination of global toroidal flow damping and resonant torques induced by nonaxisymmetric magnetic field components, poloidal magnetic field transients, and momentum source effects, as well as the usual collision- and microturbulence-induced transport. On the transport time scale, the plasma toroidal rotation determines the radial electric field for net ambipolar particle transport. The ultimate radial particle transport is composed of intrinsically ambipolar fluxes plus nonambipolar fluxes evaluated at this toroidal-rotation-determined radial electric field.},

	abstract = {In divertor tokamak plasmas with intense additional heating a large fraction of the power deposited at the target has been attributed to the collisionless losses of energetic ions from a region of about twice an ion poloidal Larmor radius inside the plasma boundary. These energetic ion losses can also strongly effect the formation of the radial electric field at the plasma edge, and may be responsible for the L to H transition. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of loss ion orbits at the tokamak edge. A particle following code has been developed to assess the detailed shape of the loss cone of escaping ions in velocity space, its transformation in the presence of a radial electric field, the shape of the loss orbits and the effect of the reversal of the toroidal magnetic field. The results obtained allow one to calculate the total amount of direct ion losses, which is expected to be substantially less than that estimated from the simplified assumptions used, because of the narrowness of the loss cone. The complex response of the ion loss cone to changes in radial electric field can potentially create a condition of instability (like the L to H transition) with rapid growth of the negative potential inside the plasma boundary. Numerical simulations have shown a relatively weak dependence of the energetic ion behaviour on the exact profile of the potential, suggesting that the resonant effects of the ion interaction with the magnetic field, expected from the theory of an idealized large aspect ratio tokamak (r/R{\textless}{\textless}1) and leading, for instance, to the effect of banana orbit squeezing, may not exist.},

Properties of the radial electric field bifurcation are studied taking into account the effect of electrode biasing. The radial electric field structure is determined by the charge conservation equation. From the nonlinear mechanism associated with local current due to ion bulk viscosity, a transition can take place. Various types of radial electric field structures with multiple peaks are allowed for the same boundary condition. The ion orbit loss term breaks the symmetry of the radial current similarly to the ambipolar radial electric field. A radial current driven by the electrode plays the role of a control parameter in a transition similarly to the pressure gradient. A phase diagram is given in the spontaneous drive vs external drive space. Differences in the radial shape of solitary electric field structures are demonstrated in the presence of spatial varying components.

A typical example of that in magnetically confined plasmas is the Low confinement mode to High confinement mode (L--H) transition, which is intensely studied for more than thirty years since it provides a confinement improvement necessary for the realization of the fusion reactor. An essential issue in the L--H transition physics is the mechanism of the abrupt “radial” electric field generation in toroidal plasmas. To date, several models for the L--H transition have been proposed but the systematic experimental validation is still challenging. Here we report the systematic and quantitative model validations of the radial electric field excitation mechanism for the first time, using a data set of the turbulence and the radial electric field having a high spatiotemporal resolution. Examining time derivative of Poisson’s equation, the sum of the loss-cone loss current and the neoclassical bulk viscosity current is found to behave as the experimentally observed radial current that excites the radial electric field within a few factors of magnitude.},

	abstract = {We investigate the dynamics of the low(L) -{\textgreater} high(H) transition using a time-dependent, one dimensional (in radius) model which self-consistently describes the time evolution of zonal flows (ZFs), mean flows (MFs), poloidal spin-up, and density and pressure profiles. The model represents the physics of ZF and MF competition, turbulence suppression via ExB shearing, and poloidal flows driven by turbulence. Numerical solutions of this model show that the L--H transition can occur via an intermediate phase (I-phase) which involves oscillations of profiles due to ZF and MF competition. The I-phase appears as a nonlinear transition wave originating at the edge boundary and propagates inward. Locally, I-phase exhibits the characteristics of a limit-cycle oscillation. All these observations are consistent with recent experimental results. We examine the trigger of the L--H transition, by defining a ratio of the rate of energy transfer from the turbulence to the zonal flow to the rate of energy input into the turbulence. When the ratio exceeds order unity, ZF shear gains energy, and a net decay of the turbulence is possible, thus triggering the L--H transition. Numerical calculations indicate that the L--H transition is triggered by this peak of the normalized ZF shearing. Zonal flows act as “reservoir,” in which to store increasing fluctuation energy without increasing transport, thus allowing the mean flow shear to increase and lock in the transition. A counterpart of the L--I--H transition, i.e., an L--H transition without I--phase, is obtained in a fast power ramp, for which I-phase is compressed into a single burst of ZF, which triggers the transition. Effects of neutral charge exchange on the L--H transition are studied by varying ZF damping and neoclassical viscosity. Results show that the predicted L--H transition power increases when either ZF damping or viscosity increase, suggesting a link between recycling, ZF damping, and the L--H threshold. Studies of fueling effects on the transition and pedestal structure with an emphasis on the particle pinch are reported.},

However, the transition exhibits dynamic behaviour naturally corresponding to bifurcations (sharp transitions, dithering, hysteresis). Any physical model attempting to explain this transition should therefore also exhibit such bifurcations. In this research a numerical solver named Bifurcator was developed. It uses the method of lines using second order central differences in combination with a diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta method. Bifurcator was applied to two 1D (parabolic) transport models for the transition from low to high confinement mode.  Both models exhibited the bifurcations associated with the transition.  Furthermore, the locations of these bifurcations in parameter space qualitatively agreed with theoretical predictions. This agreement indicates that the numerical methods are indeed suitable to study bifurcations in 1D transport models, and thus that more complex models for which theoretical analysis is not viable can be studied numerically using Bifurcator.},

The electron channel does not play any role. The 3D magnetic field perturbations used to mitigate the edge-localized modes are found to also influence the L–H transition and to increase the power threshold. This effect is caused by a flattening of the edge pressure gradient in the presence of the 3D fields such that the L–H transitions with and without perturbations occur at the same value of the radial electric field well, but at different heating powers.},

	abstract = {Experiments in tokamaks (nuclear fusion reactors) have shown two modes of operation: L--mode and H--mode. Transitions between these two modes have been observed in three types: sharp, smooth and oscillatory. The same modes of operation and transitions between them have been observed
in simplified transport models of the fusion plasma in one spatial dimension. We study the dynamics in such a one-dimensional transport model by numerical continuation techniques. To this end the MATLAB package CL\_MATCONTL was extended with the continuation of (codimension-2) Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations in three parameters using subspace reduction techniques. During the continuation of
(codimension-2) Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations in 3 parameters, generically degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations of codimension-3 are detected. However, when these techniques are applied to the transport model, we detect a degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 4. The nearby 1- and 2-parameter slices are in agreement with the presence of this codimension-4 degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation, and all three types of L--H transitions can be recognized in these slices. The same codimension-4 situation is observed under variation of the additional parameters in the model, and under some modifications of the model.},

	abstract = {Experiments have been performed on ASDEX Upgrade to clarify the nature of the radial electric field, E\_r , in the edge transport barrier of tokamak plasmas. Highly resolved radial profiles of E\_r have been diagnosed spectroscopically through the radial force balance of impurity ions. We show that in the fully developed, highly collisional edge pedestal the nature of the radial electric field is neoclassical. This requires, in particular, that the main ion poloidal rotation is at neoclassical levels. Both main ion and impurity ion poloidal rotation profiles have been measured in deuterium, hydrogen and helium plasmas with main ion pedestal top collisionalities, ν\_*,i , between 1.2 and 12. These profiles have been compared to a hierarchy of neoclassical models (from a conventional description to a comprehensive model including finite orbit width effects). They are found, in all cases, to be in good agreement demonstrating that inside the edge transport barrier the E\_r well is sustained by the gradients of the main ion species.},

	abstract = {In more than three decades, a large amount of models and mechanisms have been proposed to describe a very beneficial feature of magnetically confined fusion plasmas: the L--H transition. Bifurcation theory can be used to compare these different models based on their dynamical transition structure. In this paper, we employ bifurcation theory to distinguish two fundamentally different descriptions of the interaction between turbulence levels and sheared flows. The analytic bifurcation analysis characterises the parameter space structure of the transition dynamics. Herewith, in these models three dynamically different types of transitions are characterised, sharp transitions, oscillatory transitions, and smooth transitions. One of the two models has a very robust transition structure and is therefore likely to be more accurate for such a robust phenomenon as the L--H transition. The other model needs more fine-tuning to get non-oscillatory transitions. These conclusions from the analytic bifurcation analysis are confirmed by dedicated numerical simulations, with the newly developed code Bifurcator.},

We focus on the periodic L--H--L transitions known as ‘‘dithering H mode’’ and show that there is an intrinsic time scale in this process which is characteristic for the L--H transition. We give a tentative explanation for the phenomenon using an extension of Itoh’s model for the L--H transition and find that this simple bifurcation model can qualitatively explain many of the experimental observations. According to our model, the dithering cycles are a limit cycle oscillation due to a difference in the response of the system to a rise in either T or n. The implications for H--mode theories are discussed.},
