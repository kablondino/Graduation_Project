## Topic: Electric field bifurcation in the tokamak edge.

#### _Written by Dr. Hugo de Blank_

### Introduction:
The transition between L-mode and H-mode is a bifurcation in the turbulent transport in the edge (just inside the separatrix) of a divertor tokamak. A key mechanism for transition to H-mode is the generation of a large radial electric field and corresponding $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow and large flow shear near the edge, which suppresses the turbulent transport. Many possible mechanisms for the generation of such an electric field have been proposed. Most mechanisms can be viewed as separate contributions in a radial Poisson's law, in addition to some terms that tend to reduce the field.

Research at DIFFER has shown that independent of the details of the electric field generation, the L-H transition model exhibits universal bifurcation behaviour, including: hysteresis between L-H and H-L jumps, disappearance of hysteresis and change to smooth L-H transitions at a cusp-bifucation, and a transition from the cusp-situation to one without cusp due to oscillatory solutions (i.e. lack of a steady state).

### Possible research questions:

1. Which electric field-generating terms are dominant in concrete
   experimental tokamak conditions?

	+ Choose a tokamak (e.g. ASDEX-Upgrade, JET)

	+ Determine tokamak edge parameters. (Focus on experiments dedicated to L-H transitions, for which relevant measurements co-exist.

	+ Take note of electric field-generating terms that have already been estimated and published.

	+ Compute the remaining terms.

	+ Discuss if these terms make sense and what can be concluded, considering error bars.

2. ~~Can L-H transitions be linked theoretically to increase of heating power / heat flux through separatrix above the L-H power threshold?~~

	- ~~Relate moment of transition to time-resolved separatrix power through transport modelling (seek advice Dick Hogeweij)~~

3. ~~What is the scaling of the L-H power threshold?~~

	- ~~Take note of existing scaling laws~~

	- ~~Determine scaling within the studied parameter range~~

	- ~~Determine changes of scaling laws when moving to a different parameter range (e.g. extrapolating to reactor size)~~

	- ~~Determine "meta-scalings" including transitions between different power laws in different parameter ranges.~~

4. ~~What is the scaling with power, density, machine size, isotope?~~

	- ~~Again, be alert on transitions between parameter regimes where different field-generating terms dominate.~~

5. ~~What are the effects on H-mode of divertor detachment control measures such as influx of radiating impurities?~~

	- ~~Look at neutral particle influx and charge exchange friction. (friction effect is probably more important than radiative cooling)~~

6. ~~What are the effects on H-mode of ELM control measures, such as edge stochastization?~~

	- ~~Look at effect of stochastization on the pressure gradient~~
