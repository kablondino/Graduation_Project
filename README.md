### Topic: Electric field bifurcation in the tokamak edge.

### Introduction:
The transition between L-mode and H-mode is a bifurcation in the turbulent transport in the edge (just inside the separatrix) of a divertor tokamak. A key mechanism for transition to H-mode is the generation of a large radial electric field and corresponding $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow and large flow shear near the edge, which suppresses the turbulent transport. Many possible mechanisms for the generation of such an electric field have been proposed. Most mechanisms can be viewed as separate contributions in a radial Poisson's law, in addition to some terms that tend to reduce the field.

Research at DIFFER has shown that independent of the details of the electric field generation, the L-H transition model exhibits universal bifurcation behaviour, including: hysteresis between L-H and H-L jumps, disappearance of hysteresis and change to smooth L-H transitions at a cusp-bifucation, and a transition from the cusp-situation to one without cusp due to oscillatory solutions (i.e. lack of a steady state).
