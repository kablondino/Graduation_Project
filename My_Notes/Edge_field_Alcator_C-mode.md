# Notes on _Edge radial electric field structure and its connections to H-mode confinement in Alcator C-Mod plasmas_
## I. Introduction

+ H-mode plasmas have a negative radial electric field well forms just inside the last-closed flux surface (LCFS)

+ On DIII-D, the evolution of the field has been observed prior to the transition, by measuring an increase in the edge impurity poloidal velocity in the electron diamagnetic direction.

+ The details of $E_r$ well structure vary from machine to machine, although many report similar observations.

+ _EDA_ stands for Enhanced D-Alpha H-mode.

## II. The Edge CXRS Diagnositic on Alcator C-Mod

$$E_r \,=\, \frac{1}{n_i Z_i e} \frac{\text{d}p_i}{\text{d}r} - V_{\theta i} B_\phi + V_{\phi i} B_\theta$$

+ The above ignores the contributions from the Reynolds stress and off-diagonal terms in the pressure tensor.

	+ Measurements of the impurity ion dist. function indicate that it is Maxwellian, justifying the simplification of the stress tensor to the gradient of the pressure.

	+ The three terms are:

		+ Diamagnetic $\dfrac{1}{n_i Z_i e} \dfrac{\text{d}p_i}{\text{d}r}$

		+ Poloidal velocity $V_{\theta i} B_\phi$

		+ Toroidal velocity $V_{\phi i} B_\theta$

	+ To calculate $E_r$ accurately, one needs the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields and velocities, as well as the temperature and density for a particular species.
