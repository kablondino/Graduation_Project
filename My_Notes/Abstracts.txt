# Chapter 2 (presection)
The most successful present-day fusion devices are the tokamaks.
The world record of fusion power production is achieved by the JET tokamak in 1997[1], the fusion reactions produced more than 16 MW.
This world record was only possible due to the formation of the H-mode transport barrier.
Therefore, this H-mode state of the plasma will be the standard scenario for operating future fusion devices.
This chapter elaborates on the characteristics of the H-mode and the observed transition dynamics.
Furthermore, the current understanding of the underlying mechanism and some possible models are discussed.

# Chapter 3 (presection)
Nonlinear dynamical systems can exhibit all kinds of rich behaviour.
Depending on the parameter settings of the model the temporal evolution of dynamical systems can be completely different.
However, small changes of the parameters do not always qualitatively change the dynamics, such that there could be entire regions in parameter space that show qualitatively similar behaviour.
Only when crossing the boundaries of these regions in parameter space the topological structure of the dynamic solutions changes; these boundaries are called bifurcations.
Thus, the bifurcation boundaries divide the entire parameter space of a certain model in regions with qualitatively the same type of solutions.
Since the L-mode and H-mode are qualitatively distinct they are most likely separated by a bifurcation; especially the different characteristic types of transitions between them are indications of typical bifurcations.
Bifurcation analysis of L-H transition models can directly determine if these different types of dynamics are present in those models, and in which part of its parameter space they will occur.
With this technique physical mechanisms can be combined to get a more complete picture of the physics generating the different types of transitions, and to find which parameters can be used to go from one regime to another.

# Chapter 4
The mathematical field of bifurcation theory is extended to be applicable to 1-dimensionally resolved systems of nonlinear partial differential equations, aimed at the determination of a certain specific bifurcation.
This extension is needed to be able to properly analyze the bifurcations of the radial transport in magnetically confined fusion plasmas.
This is of special interest when describing the transition from the low-energy-confinement state to the high-energy confinement state of the radial transport in fusion plasmas (i.e. the L-H transition), because the nonlinear dynamical behavior during the transition corresponds to the dynamical behavior of a system containing such a specific bifurcation.
This bifurcation determines how the three types (sharp, smooth, and oscillating) of observed L-H transitions are organized as function of all the parameters contained in the model.

# Chapter 5
Transitions between low and high-confinement (L-H transitions) in magnetically confined plasmas can appear as three qualitatively different types: sharp, smooth, and oscillatory.
Bifurcation analysis unravels these possible transition types and how they are situated in parameter space.
In this paper the bifurcation analysis is applied to a 1-dimensional model for the radial transport of energy and density near the edge of magnetically confined plasmas.
This phenomenological L-H transition model describes the reduction of the turbulent transport by E Ã— B-flow shear self-consistently with the evolution of the radial electric field.
Therewith, the exact parameter space, including the threshold values of the control parameters, of the possible L-H transitions in the model is determined.
Furthermore, a generalised equal area rule is derived to describe the evolution of the transport barrier in space and time self-consistently.
Applying this newly developed rule to the model analysed in this paper reveals a naturally occurring transition to an extra wide transport barrier that may correspond to the improved confinement known as the very- high-confinement mode.

# Chapter 6
In more than three decades a large amount of models and mechanisms have been proposed to describe a very beneficial feature of magnetically confined fusion plasmas: the L-H transition.
Bifurcation theory can be used to compare these different models based on their dynamical transition structure.
In this paper we employ bifurcation theory to distinguish two fundamentally different descriptions of the interaction between turbulence levels and sheared flows.
The analytic bifurcation analysis characterises the parameter space tructure of the transition dynamics.
Herewith, in these models three dynamically different types of transitions are characterised, sharp transitions, oscillatory transitions and smooth transitions.
One of the two models has a very robust transition structure and is therefore more likely to be more accurate for such a robust phenomenon as the L-H transition.
The other model needs more fine-tuning to get non-oscillatory transitions.
These conclusions from the analytic bifurcation analysis are confirmed by dedicated numerical simulations, with the newly developed code Bifurcator.
