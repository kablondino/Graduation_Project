<h2 id="chapter-1-introduction">Chapter 1 Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="l-h-transition">1.2 L-H Transition</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>L-mode: turbulence enhances radial transport</p></li>
<li><p>H-mode: local reduction in transport (at edge)</p>
<ul>
<li>The edge therefore has an &quot;edge transport barrier&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There is NO consensus on what plasma physics mechanism causes spontaneous transition from L-mode to H-mode</p></li>
<li><p>3 different types of dynamics of transition are observed: sharp (sudden), oscillatory, and smooth</p></li>
<li><p>Bifurcation theory is the mathematical study of qualitative changes in the solutions of dynamical systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="research-questions">1.3 Research Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The MAIN question: How can we employ bifurcation theory to unravel the L-H transition mechanism?</p></li>
<li><p>Since physical systems can only have a limited number of bifurcations, what bifurcation structure can be recognized in L-H transition dynamics?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we identify the co-dimension 3 bifurcation in 1-D models?</p></li>
<li><p>How do these 1-D bifurcating models combine transitions in time and space?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the bifurcation structure of the model proosed by Zohm?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the bifurcation structure change when changing the transport reduction mechanism?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the bifurcation structure change when adding an extra dynamical equation for turbulence? <strong>AND</strong> What is the best dynamical description of the turbulence reduction by sheared <span class="math">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span>-flows?</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="experimental-observations">2.1 Experimental Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;The complex, nonlinear behavior of the plasma and very fast timescales of the transition makes it very hard to discriminate the cause and effect relations between the many evolving physical quantities.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, usually diagnostics are not quick enough, so they only see the initial L-mode and the final H-mode.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Transport in most of the tokamak is the same regardless of mode; only in the edge is turbulence quenched in H-mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(p\)</span> profiles locally steepen inside the transport barrier. This makes H-mode look like L-mode on a pedestal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The most promising observation on why the turbulence is reduced is the acceleration of flows during the transition.</p></li>
<li><p>The 3 different types of dynamics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Sharp: most common. When heating is slowly increased above a threshold, it suddenly goes from L- to H-mode; additionally, it will stay in H-mode if the heating is reduced below the initial threshold. This means there is hysteresis characteristics.</p></li>
<li><p>Smooth: Low-density discharge in JT-60U and DIII-D with slow heating power increase caused a very smooth transition, with no clear bifurcation.</p></li>
<li><p>Oscillatory: self-explanatory, but can take many different forms, with many different names. Each different form may or may not have different mechanisms, or combinations of mechanisms</p></li>
</ol></li>
