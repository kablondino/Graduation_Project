<ul>
<li><p>The MAIN question: How can we employ bifurcation theory to unravel the L-H transition mechanism?</p></li>
<li><p>Since physical systems can only have a limited number of bifurcations, what bifurcation structure can be recognized in L-H transition dynamics?</p></li>
<li><p>How can we identify the co-dimension 3 bifurcation in 1-D models?</p></li>
<li><p>How do these 1-D bifurcating models combine transitions in time and space?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the bifurcation structure of the model proosed by Zohm?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the bifurcation structure change when changing the transport reduction mechanism?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the bifurcation structure change when adding an extra dynamical equation for turbulence? <strong>AND</strong> What is the best dynamical description of the turbulence reduction by sheared <span class="math">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span>-flows?</p></li>

<h3 id="experimental-observations">2.1 Experimental Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;The complex, nonlinear behavior of the plasma and very fast timescales of the transition makes it very hard to discriminate the cause and effect relations between the many evolving physical quantities.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, usually diagnostics are not quick enough, so they only see the initial L-mode and the final H-mode.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Transport in most of the tokamak is the same regardless of mode; only in the edge is turbulence quenched in H-mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(p\)</span> profiles locally steepen inside the transport barrier. This makes H-mode look like L-mode on a pedestal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The most promising observation on why the turbulence is reduced is the acceleration of flows during the transition.</p></li>
<li><p>The 3 different types of dynamics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Sharp: most common. When heating is slowly increased above a threshold, it suddenly goes from L- to H-mode; additionally, it will stay in H-mode if the heating is reduced below the initial threshold. This means there is hysteresis characteristics.</p></li>
<li><p>Smooth: Low-density discharge in JT-60U and DIII-D with slow heating power increase caused a very smooth transition, with no clear bifurcation.</p></li>
<li><p>Oscillatory: self-explanatory, but can take many different forms, with many different names. Each different form may or may not have different mechanisms, or combinations of mechanisms</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="related-physical-mechanisms">2.2 Related Physical Mechanisms</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Many proposed mechanisms are one of two things: the trigger of the transition, or the sustaining of the H-mode.</p></li>
<li><p>One mechanism for sustainment is the reduction of turbulence by sheared flows. The shearing of turbulent eddies until they break into smaller eddies is well known.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there are different flows in plasmas because of mass difference.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each species' flows can be decomposed into orthogonal directions: poloidal and toroidal directions or parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field.</p></li>
<li><p>Further, these mass flows are driven by different effects, so flows can be decomposed into driving terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Diamagnetic flow, driven by <span class="math">\(\nabla p\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span>-flow, driven by the <span class="math">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>-field. This is the <strong>SAME</strong> for all particles, independent of mass and charge: <span class="math">\[v_{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}} \,=\, \frac{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}{B^2}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>According to Burrell's paper of 1994, the <span class="math">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span>-flow reduces (ion temperature-driven) turbulence, tearing apart eddies. Also, because the flow works the same on all particles, it can stabilize all possible modes.</p></li>
<li><p>This makes it a very universal mechanism for stabilization. There <strong>is</strong> a consensus on this and is accepted. A radial electric field well has be observed near the edge of an H-mode plasma.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The main experimental parameter is heating; heat flux at the outer bits is more relevant. Ions are shown to be the ones to contribute more, since at low <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, the energy exchange between <span class="math">\(e^-\)</span> and ions is limited and lots of ECRH is needed for H-mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, since heating is more financially and practically dealt with, the threshold values need to be found in terms of the ion heat flux.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Another decomposition of flows is encountered: the division between zonal and mean flows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Zonal flows are defined as driven by turbulence itself, and result in small fluctuations of the radial <span class="math">\(\mathbf{E}\)</span>-field on top of the amount that causes the mean <span class="math">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span>-flow.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no clear separation in length scales between the two... so it is unclear how they are distinct.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chapter-3-bifurcation-theory">Chapter 3: Bifurcation Theory</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A bifurcation boundary divides the entire parameter space of a certain model into regions with qualitatively the same type of solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since L-mode and H-mode are qualitatively distinct, they are most likely separated by a bifurcation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="introduction">3.1 Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A bifurcation is a topological change in the dynamical solution when a small and smooth change of a parameter is made.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamical systems are described in terms of DE's as <span class="math">\(\dot{x} \,=\, f(x)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is a dynamic variable, and <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> is an arbitrary function of that variable and probably depends on some parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The classic (and simple) example of a bifurcation is when <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is quadratic with <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, as the following: <span class="math">\(\dot{x} \,=\, a + x^2\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is the control parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>As long as <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is negative, there are two solutions: <span class="math">\(x_0 \,=\, \pm\sqrt{-a}\)</span> (negative is stable, positive is unstable). However, when <span class="math">\(a = 0\)</span>, there is only 1 equilibrium point, and is called a saddle-node fixed point. If <span class="math">\(a &gt; 0\)</span>, there are no equilibrium points. This is known as the <em>fold bifurcation</em>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The simplest form of any bifurcating system can be reduced is called the <em>topological norm form</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The least number of parameters needed to construct this topological norm form is called the <em>co-dimension</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Bifurcation theory describes BOTH the existence of stationary states but also analyzes the stability of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Let's introduce a perturbation <span class="math">\(x \,\mapsto\, x_0 + x_1 e^{\lambda t}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(x_0 \gg x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> as the eigenvalue, which sign determines if the perturbation grows or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a system of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> equations, the eigenvalues become <span class="math">\(N\)</span>-dimensional complex vectors, with the signs of the real parts determining what is attracting or repelling.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <em>Hopf bifurcation</em> is another with co-dimension 1, with the real part of a pair of complex conjugated eigenvalues vanishing.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This means that the referred steady-state changes from unstable to stable, or vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Supercritical Hopf bifucation</em> is when there is a stable limit cycle surrounding the steady-state.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Subcritical</em> is when there is an unstable (repelling) limit cycle surrounding the steady-state.</p></li>
<li><p>When an unstable limit cycle grows and touches the stable limit cycle, they both vanish, causing a <em>global fold bifurcation</em>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bifurcations-vs-l-h-transition-dynamics">3.2 Bifurcations vs L-H Transition Dynamics</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Different types of observed transition dynamics can be recognized as certain types of bifurcations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fold bifurcations are the natural way to describe sharp transitions, such as L-H AND H-L transitions; the natural way to combine two folds is shown in Fig 3.3.</p></li>
<li><p>This gives TWO critical values for <span class="math">\(a\)</span>; this hysteresis behavior is characteristic of two co-dimension 1 fold bifurcations coming from a co-dimension 2 cusp bifurcation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The norm form of this: <span class="math">\(\dot{x} \,=\, a - bx - x^3\)</span>; <span class="math">\(b\)</span> determines the size of the hysteresis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The cusp bifurcation separates the parameter space into two regions: one with sharp transitions with hysteresis, and one with smooth transitions without fold bifurcations (with <span class="math">\(a\)</span> being what's scanned).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Therefore, the cusp bif. organizes two types of L-H transition dynamics: smooth and sharp. Oscillatory behavior can arise due to a Hopf bif.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a way that the Hopf bif. can be combined with the cusp bif, which can be view as a <em>degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bif</em>. This is <strong>the</strong> co-dimension 3 bif. referenced here.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several equivalent unfoldings of this bif., seen as Eq. 3-5</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The original cusp bif. equation is coupled to a damped variable; as long as the coupled constant <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is below a critical value, the parameter space is the same as indicated in Fig. 3.3c.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any additional coupling will cause the model to be very sensitive to perturbations, making it less robust of a candidate for the L-H transition.</p></li>
<li><p>At the critical value of <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, the co-dimension 3 bif. is encountered at the position of the cusp bif. A regime of limit cycle solutions opens up, covering the original cusp. See Fig. 3.4.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The limit of cycle solutions are produced by Hopf bifs. If both steady-states are unstable, the system will oscillate according to this limit cycle. However, if one steady-state turns stable, the system will transit towards it.</p></li>
<li><p>Oscillatory solutions only occur in the region surrounding the cusp bif. point where there are no steady-states.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The specific arrangement of smooth and sharp transitions separated by the oscillatory transitions is characteristic of an underlying co-dimension 3 bif. The quality of an H-mode model can be judged by the existence of the co-dimension 3 bif.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the model does not contain this bif., it can not describe all different types of L-H transitions.</p></li>
<li><p>If a model does describe all of the types of transitions without having this co-dimension 3 bif., there is a parameter in the model that could pull behavior into inappropriate regions of parameter space, <em>e.g.</em> oscillations far away from the L-H transition point. Therefore, co-dimension 3 bif is required to be robust.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="introduction-1">4.1 Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Two separate fold bifurcations are necessary to describe the hysteresis, since the heating to trigger the L-H transistion is different than for H-L transition.</p></li>
<li><p>Two types of parameters affect the existence and magnitude of the hysteresis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One controls the existence by causing the two fold bifs. to meet in the cusp bif. This causes smooth transitions.</p></li>
<li><p>The second causes the hysteresis to be replaced by limit cycle oscillations from a Hopf bif.</p></li>
<li><p>These two parameters branch off in parameter space out of the underlying co-dimension 3 bif. The analysis of this bif. it is possible to find how the parameters affect the evolution.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The lowest-order system containing this co-dimension 3 bif. is the Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo: <span class="math">\[\dot{x} \,=\, -a - bx - x^3 + cy \\ \dot{y} \,=\, -x - y\]</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <span class="math">\(c = 0\)</span>, the steady state solutions can have one or multiple possibilities depending on <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</li>
