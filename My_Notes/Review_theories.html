<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>ASDEX found an empirical law for the heating required for H-mode (with some nuance): <span class="math display">\[P_{h} \,=\, 0.04 \, \bar{n}_e \, B \, S\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Above, in MW, with <span class="math inline">\(\bar{n_e}\)</span> as the line-averaged electron density in units of <span class="math inline">\(10^{20}\)</span> m<span class="math inline">\(^{-3}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as the magnetic field strength, and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as the plasma surface area.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>L-H transition requires less heating when the magnetic field config. is such that the ion-<span class="math inline">\(\nabla B\)</span> drift direction is towards a single null formed by the divertor geometry, rather than away from it.</p></li>
<li><p>Wagner [11] assumes, for the above empirical law, that the transition occurs with the ion diamagnetic velocity achieves some critical value: <span class="math display">\[V_{*i} \,=\, -\frac{1}{n e B} \frac{\text{d}p_i}{\text{d}r} \,=\, V_{crit}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Since the transition is an edge phenomenon, it's possible an addition atomic physics parameter is involved. This means one cannot scale the plasma temperature.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="i-local-edge-parameters">(i) <em>Local edge parameters</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Also, since the transition occurs at the edge, one would expect that the condition for it to occur can be expressed in terms of local parameter one would expect that the condition for it to occur can be expressed in terms of local parameters and length scales of the edge.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Models are usually expressed in terms of such quantities, or equivalent dimensionless parameters such as the normalized Larmor radius <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{*} \,=\, \rho_i \,/\, a\)</span>, collisionality, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of local plasma parameters, hysteresis is less obvious, but the critical temperature responds to the ion-<span class="math inline">\(\nabla B\)</span> drift in the same manner as <span class="math inline">\(P_h\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ii-spatial-and-temporal-characteristics">(ii) <em>Spatial and temporal characteristics</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>How the edge region scales is a potential test of theories.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Transition usually occurs at sub-millisecond or microsecond scales, with a slower evolution in the millisecond range.</p></li>
<li><p>The temporal sequence of events for testing the theory: the creation of steep electric field gradients, suppression of turbulence, and steepening of density and temperature profiles.</p></li>
<li><p>It is tackled in 3 different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dimensional analysis, with confinement properties and energy balance involving cross-field transport into the SOL.</p></li>
<li><p>Stabilization of instabilities to cause transport in L-mode</p></li>
<li><p><strong>!!</strong> The mechanisms producing bifurcations, such as electric fields and flows. SEE REFERENCES!</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>While the stabilization of some linear instability responsible for transport may be part of it, it is unlikely to account for the rapid changes usually observed in the L-H transition since stability criteria usually depend on parameters that change on a transport timescale.</p></li>
<li><p>The theories are divided into 3 basic groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Those that rely on achieving conditions of plasma parameters for the stabilization of particular instabilities or suppression of the associated turbulence. They are then subdivided into the edge of the core and those in the SOL.</p></li>
<li><p>Those that rely on the suppression of turbulent transport by sheared radial electric fields or plasma flow, further classified by the physical processes that drive and limit these quantities.</p></li>
<li><p>Those that are considered miscellaneous mechanisms, such as effects arising from divertor action, neoclassical theory, and particular transport models that don't fit above; for example, the role of neoclassical drifts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>All of this is summarized in two tables in the appendix.</p></li>

<h2 id="theoretical-considerations">2. Theoretical Considerations</h2>
<h3 id="a-dimensional-analysis">2.1 <em>A dimensional analysis</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>In terms of plasma physics, expect to be able to represent the L-H transition condition by <span class="math inline">\(\rho \propto \beta^x \nu^y\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="edge-power-balance">2.2 <em>Edge power balance</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A more consistent approach to obtaining the transition condition is to used a local edge power balance to determine radial length scales, relating to the SOL width <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can relate the outflow of power into the SOL to a local model for the heat flux across the magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(q_\perp\)</span> at the edge: <span class="math display">\[P \propto a R n q_\perp \sim a R n \chi_\perp T / \Delta\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The power into the SOL must be transported along the field lines to the divertor plates (<span class="math inline">\(q_\parallel\)</span> is heat flux parallel to the magnetic field): <span class="math display">\[P \sim \frac{q_{\parallel} \Delta a}{q}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Some assumptions are needed for the perp and parallel heat transport in the SOL: give estimates when perp transport is either Bohm or gyro-Bohm and when parallel transport is dominated by either collisional diffusion or by flow at sound speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Balance perp and parallel heat flows in the SOL give: <span class="math display">\[\Delta(SOL) \sim \sqrt{\frac{n T \chi_\perp R q}{q_\parallel}}\]</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The results of taking each assumption is given by Eqs. (2.24) through (2.27).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-shear-flow-paradigm">2.3 <em>The shear flow paradigm</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Sheared radial electric fields reduce turbulent transport by either stabilization of linear modes or through a reduction of turbulence amplitudes, correlation lengths, or a change in phases between the fluctuations responsible for the turbulent transport fluxes.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(V^{\prime}_E\)</span> denotes the radial derivative of the equilibrium <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}\)</span> velocity, <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A limit on sheared rotation was found: <span class="math inline">\(\omega_s &gt; \omega_t\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\omega_s = k_\theta \Delta r V_E^\prime\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta r\)</span> as the radial correlation length and <span class="math inline">\(k_\theta\)</span> as a characteristic poloidal wavenumber of the turbulence.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\omega_t = 4D / (\Delta r)^2\)</span> as the diffusive scattering rate, with <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> being the turbulent diffusivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Turbulent eddies are torn apart by the differing <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> flows at different radial locations within the eddy, shown in Fig. 7.</p></li>
<li><p>Further analysis of a model equation showed that turbulence suppression occurs when <span class="math inline">\(|\omega_t| &lt; |\omega_s|\)</span>, which is known as the Biglari-Diamond-Terry (BDT) criterion, which can also be written as: <span class="math display">\[V_E^\prime &gt; (\Delta r k_\theta \tau_c)^{-1}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau_c\)</span> is the turbulent decorrelation time, which can be considered on the order of the inverse of the diamagnetic freq.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A more complete expression for <span class="math inline">\(\omega_s\)</span> is shown in Eq. (2.31), where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \phi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \eta\)</span> are correlation angles for the turbulence around the torus and along the field line, respectively: <span class="math display">\[\omega_s^2 \,=\, (\Delta r)^2 \left[\frac{1}{(\Delta \phi)^2} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(\frac{q V_e}{r}\right)\right)^2 + \frac{1}{(\Delta \eta)^2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(\frac{V_\parallel}{q R}\right)\right)^2\right]\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>After some generalizations, and assuming the correlation 'lengths' and electrostatic potential <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> are constant on a flux surface, it can be reduced (the proportionality hold when <span class="math inline">\(\Delta r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \theta\)</span> are fixed): <span class="math display">\[\omega_s \,=\, \frac{R^2 B_\theta^2}{r B_\phi} \left(\frac{\Delta r}{\Delta \theta}\right) \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \psi^2} \,\propto\, R^3\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>When turbulence is isotropic (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta r \sim r\Delta \theta\)</span>), it can be written that (Eq. (2.34)): <span class="math display">\[\omega_s \,=\, \frac{RB_\theta}{B} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{E_r}{RB_\theta}\right)\]</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The curvature of <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> does not have a generic effect on turbulence, but can affect specific instabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>The transport coefficients are taken to be suppressed by the presence of <span class="math inline">\(\omega_s\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[D \,=\, \frac{D_0}{1 + c\left(\frac{\omega_s}{\omega_t}\right)^\gamma}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Another mechanism for reducing transport is the effect of <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span> on the cross-phase of the fluctuations contributing to the transport flux (source [67]).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="radial-electric-fields">2.4 <em>Radial electric fields</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(V_E^\prime\)</span> is determined by the radial electric field <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>, which is then deduced from the radial force balance for any plasma species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> (Eq. (2.38)): <span class="math display">\[E_r \,=\, -\frac{1}{n_j e_j} \frac{\text{d} p_j}{\text{d} r} + V_{\theta j} B_\phi - V_{\phi j} B_\theta\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(e_j\)</span> is charge, <span class="math inline">\(p_j\)</span> is pressure, <span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> is density, and <span class="math inline">\(V_{\theta j}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_{\phi j}\)</span> are the poloidal and toroidal velocities.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, changes in <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> can be associated with changes in <span class="math inline">\(V_{\theta j}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_{\phi j}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(p_j^\prime\)</span> (the prime is the radial derivative).</p></li>
<li><p>The ones that vary in the poloidal velocity correspond to bifurcations in the solutions of the poloidal momentum balance equation, requiring a momentum source/torque and sink.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sources: ion-orbit loss, non-ambipolar electron loss, Stringer spin-up due to poloidal asymmetries in turbulent transport, Reynolds stress from turbulence, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Sinks: ion parallel neoclassical viscosity, charge exchange on neutrals, etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Models involving <span class="math inline">\(V_{\phi j}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(p_j^\prime\)</span> depend on sources of particles (neutrals surrounding the plasma, neutral beams), energy (heating), or toroidal momentum (neutral beams) driving <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span> until a transport bifurcation occurs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If one balances <span class="math inline">\(\omega_s\)</span> from Eq. (2.34) using <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> derived from the <span class="math inline">\(p^\prime\)</span> contribution in Eq. (2.38), then the criterion <span class="math inline">\(\omega_s = \gamma_{max}\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{*s} &gt; \rho_{*s,\text{crit}}\)</span>, in which <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{*s,\text{crit}}\)</span> depends on the scaling of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{max}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bifurcations">2.5 <em>Bifurcations</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Bifurcations can take place when the equation has multi-valued or non-monotonic solutions as a function of an 'order' variable, such as density or temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-valued solutions cause 'hard' bifurcations. When the solution is merely non-monotonic, it is a 'soft bif., also known as a 'first-order phase transition.' When the solution remains monotonic but undergoes a change in slope, it is called a 'second-order phase transition.'</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The poloidal torque balance has the potential to lead to a bif. in poloidal flow, and therefore <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The following section of the paper covers this in significant detail. This includes that the particle flux has a nonlinear dependence on the radial electric field.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The simplest models for the bif. physics are local in radius, but one can introduce effects to determine the radial structure of the bif. layer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A small discussion follows on determining the bif. layer width <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the bif. in <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> arises from <span class="math inline">\(V_\theta\)</span>, it could be that the poloidal gyroradius and viscosity determine it.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it could be set by transport equations for density and temperature, whose gradients drive <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>. (READ)</p></li>

<h2 id="instabilities-and-turbulence-at-the-plasma-edge">3. Instabilities and Turbulence at the Plasma Edge</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this section, some cases where the reduction in transport fluxes resulting from a self-consistent generation of sheared flows will be noted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="edge-region-of-the-core">3.1 <em>Edge Region of the Core</em></h3>
<h4 id="ideal-mhd-modes">3.1.1 <em>Ideal MHD Modes</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Bishop [77] proposes ideal MHD ballooning mode stability has a role in L-H transitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>He concludes that stability properties become progressively better in a separatrix configuration in which the X-point position moves into the region of favorable curvature and that a finite edge current allows the possibility of complete stability to both ballooning and interchange modes for surfaces close to the separatrix.</p></li>
<li>This is due partly because regions of zero local magnetic shear are move to regions of favorable curvature.</li>
<li><p>Suggests that the L-H transition occurs well below the simple ballooning limit, Eq. (3.1)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Edge plasma current can also drive instabilities (DUH). The peeling mode occurs when a resonant surface for an ideal external kink mode lies just outside the plasma surface. In cylindrical geometry, this mode is destabilized by a finite plasma current at the edge.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These (mentioned in the paper) properties suggest that L-mode is considered to be unstable to the peeling mode, resulting in a high level of magnetic fluctuations at the tokamak edge and therefore an enhanced thermal diffusivity.</p></li>
<li><p>As heating is increase, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, a parameter, will rise and eventually pass beyond the critical value required for stability; the peeling mode will then switch off and the edge confinement will improve, which can be interpreted as necessary for H-mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether the peeling mode is stabilized as power increases depends on the competition between the rise in <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and the rise in temperature, providing a possible explanation in L-H transitions between large and small tokamaks.</p></li>
<li><p>(Look into context) (iv) H-mode can be accessed by reducing the edge current by current ramp-down and by pellet injection (decreases edge temperature, which increases resistivity).</p></li>

<h2 id="models-involving-sheared-radial-electric-field-and-flows">4. Models Involving Sheared Radial Electric Field and Flows</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It is possible to classify the models by sheared radial electric fields according to the processes generating it: poloidal flow drives and damping, toroidal flows, and transport processes.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, one can separate the models according to whether or not they treat the evolution of gradients and fluctuations on the same footing.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="poloidal-torque-balance">4.1 <em>Poloidal Torque Balance</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Balance of torques driven by radial currents against poloidal viscosity or damping.</p>
<ul>
<li>The balance of these torques can lead to multiple solutions for the poloidal flow (or radial electric field); can be associated with low and high transport, <em>i.e.</em> L- and H-modes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ion-orbit-loss-theories">4.1.1 <em>Ion-Orbit Loss Theories</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Earliest model that predicts a bif. in <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>, due to Itoh and Itoh [69].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They used ion-orbit loss at the edge and balanced it against a non-ambipolar electron diffusion to derive an expression for the equilibrium radial electric field.</p></li>
<li><p>The non-ambipolarity comes from the emission of wave momentum which is not absorbed in the plasma but lost in the SOL. <span class="math display">\[\lambda_e \,=\, -\frac{T_e}{T_i} \rho_{pi} \left(\frac{n_e^\prime}{n_e} + c_e \frac{T_e^\prime}{T_e}\right)\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(c_e\)</span> is a constant of O(1) that depends on the nature of the microturbulence</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_e &lt; \lambda_c \approx \rho_{pi}^2 \nu_{ii} / (\sqrt{\epsilon} D_e)\)</span>, only one solution exists, which corresponds to a low (negative) electric field.</p></li>
<li><p>As <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_e\)</span> increases to <span class="math inline">\(\approx \lambda_c\)</span>, two new solutions exist with higher <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_e\)</span> increasing beyond <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_c\)</span>, the plasma is forced to jump to the high <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> solution. This is considered equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{*i}\)</span> being below a critical value. <span class="math display">\[\lambda_e = \lambda_c ~~~~\longrightarrow~~~~ \frac{D_e \tau \sqrt{\epsilon}}{\nu_{ii}\rho_{pi} L_n} \,\gtrapprox\, 1\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>When the previous threshold is exceeded, the resulting field is positive, at odds with experimental measurements.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Usually, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_c\)</span> is of order unity, giving <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{pi} / L_n \gtrapprox 1\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(L_n\)</span> is the density gradient length.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A later model [120] found that for a negative radial field <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>, its radial derivative <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span> flips from being small and positive in L-mode to large and negative in H-mode. This jump is hypothesized to be the confinement improvement and associated reduction in turbulence level at the time of transition. This model also has hysteresis.</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color:red">Another model has the generation of toroidal flow by ion-orbit loss with similar results, with an extension to a situation where additional heating generates energetic electrons, which are then lost due to magnetic field ripple trapping [121,122].</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A bifurcation condition arises, in which <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> signifies 'hot' electrons, <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the ripple amplitude, and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is plasma volume: <span class="math display">\[\frac{n_h}{n_i}\left(\frac{T_h}{T_i}\right)^{7/2} \,&gt;\, 0.17 \frac{\epsilon^3}{\lambda_h \delta^{3/2}} \sqrt{\frac{m_i}{m_e}} \nu_{*i}^2, ~~~~~~ \lambda_h \,=\, \frac{\rho_{pi} n_h^\prime}{n_h}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>This give a power threshold: <span class="math display">\[P_{th} \,=\, 10\epsilon^2 \frac{T_h \rho_{pi}}{T_i a} \nu_i n_i T_i V\]</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The current diffusive ballooning mode (CDBM) model has been examined [123,124], which is based on a resistive ballooning mode turbulence, but where dissipation arises from renormalized viscosity and current diffusion coefficients associated with electron inertia (supported by simulations of turbulence) [125,126].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This includes a reduction in the transport for larger <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span>, independent of sign. Using the results from this, the threshold for the L-H transition becomes [127]: <span class="math display">\[\sqrt{\frac{a}{m_i}} \, \frac{m_e}{e^2 B^2} \, \frac{a_0 q^2}{f(s)} \, \frac{|\text{d}T / \text{d}r|^{5/2}}{\rho_{pi} \nu_{ii} T} \,=\, 1\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> is a numerical coefficient and <span class="math inline">\(f(s)\)</span> is a function of magnetic shear <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, depending on the mode structure.</p></li>
<li><p>When this model is incorporated into a transport code which models the self-consistent evolution of <span class="math inline">\(p^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span>, it can produce a stable edge transport barriere [128].</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Model of Shaing and Crume also appealed to ion-orbit loss; they balanced the change in poloidal momentum, resulting from loss of the faster ions in the tail of a Maxwellian velocity dist., against the neoclassical poloidal viscous damping ('magnetic pumping'), which is dominated by slower thermal ions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The result give solutions for the poloidal flow velocity which bifurcates as the temperature is increase: a low velocity (L-mode) and high velocity (H-mode) solution.</p></li>
<li><p>The improvement in confinement is assumed to result from the effect of the sheared flow on the correlation length of the turbulence.</p></li>
<li><p>The threshold conditions again can be expressed as falling below a critical ion collisionality <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{*i}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a constant: <span class="math display">\[\frac{n R q}{\epsilon^{3/2} T_i^2} \,&lt;\, c\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Predictions of this theory include a poloidal spin-up of the plasma, hysteresis, and an associated negative radial field within a region at the plasma edge of width <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\epsilon} \rho_{pi} / \sqrt{s}\)</span>._</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the original theory was based on the assumption that the ions take up a Maxwellian velocity dist., that predicts high collisionality plasmas should not exhibit H-mode. <em>However</em>, the presence of a fast ion source invalidates that assumption.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Shaing and Zhang [130] modified the previous to include stress arising from the interaction of a magnetic field perturbation <span class="math inline">\(b_r\)</span> with the vacuum vessel in the equation for the ion poloidal velocity. Relative to the orbit-loss term, they find an effective stress which can remove the possibility of a bif. in poloidal flow leading to sheared radial electric fields: <span class="math display">\[\pi_{eff} \,=\, \frac{C_A^2 a \omega \tau_W (r_s / r_W)^{2m} (b_r / B)^2}{V_{Th i}^2 w (1 + (\omega\tau_W)^2 [1 - (r_s / r_W)^{2m}]^2)}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is the magnetic island width arising from <span class="math inline">\(b_r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is the freq in the lab frame, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_W\)</span> is the wall time constant, <span class="math inline">\(r_s\)</span> is the resonant surface for the islands, and <span class="math inline">\(r_W\)</span> is the wall radius.</p></li>
<li><p>This has the consequence that increasing <span class="math inline">\(b_r\)</span> increases <span class="math inline">\(P_{Th}\)</span> for the L-H transition; conversely, for a given <span class="math inline">\(b_r\)</span>, increasing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> assists the transition. Also, the bifurcated flow is smaller.</p></li>
<li><p>The aforementioned effects are significant when <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{eff} \geq 1\)</span>, which can occur typically for <span class="math inline">\(b_r / B \sim 4\times 10^{-4}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hinton and Kim [131] have demonstrated how to link <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> from the SOL to the core across the separatrix, where a radial current <span class="math inline">\(j_r\)</span> must flow, which allows divertor biasing to affect the core.</p></li>
<li><p>Miyamoto [132] has considered ion-orbit loss in a divertor/separatrix geometry and demonstrated that bifs. in electrostatic potential are possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Complementarily, Krasheninnikov and Yushmanov [133] show that a potential step can increase ion-orbit loss, allowing an unstable growth of potential and a L-H transition.</p></li>
<li><p>Kim et al [134] and Hinton et al [135] noted that orbit squeezing, due to electric field gradients comparable with the ion poloidal Larmor radius, can increase ion poloidal flows, thus modifying the effect of poloidal flow damping.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the same effect reduces the bootstrap current so that the radial field shear can inhibit the bootstrap current drive for MHD instabilities at the plasma edge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Change [136] has examined ion-orbit loss at the X-point, where it is most effective since the poloidal field vanishes there. A critical collisionality depending on the details of the X-point geometry and condition is found, and a layer width <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \sim \bar{\rho}_{pi}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\rho}_{pi}\)</span> is an average over the flux surface.</p></li>

<li><p>Neutrals can influence ion-orbit-loss theories in 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing both poloidal flow damping and ion-orbit losses through charge exchange with ions.??</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Itoh and Itoh [121] introduced poloidal flow damping due to momentum losses from charge exchange with neutrals. This modifies the bifurcation condition: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\lambda_e}{\lambda_c} \,=\, 1 + d_n \lambda_i, ~~~~~~~~ \lambda_i \,=\, -\rho_{pi}\left(\frac{n_i^\prime}{n_i} + \frac{c_i T_i^\prime}{T_i}\right) \\
c_i \sim 1, ~~~~~~~ d_n \,=\, \sqrt{\epsilon} \, \frac{n_o \langle\sigma_{cx} v \rangle}{\nu_{ii}F} \frac{\ell_n}{\rho_{pi}}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n_o\)</span> is the neutral density, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{cx}\)</span> is the charge exchange cross-section, <span class="math inline">\(\ell_n\)</span> is the neutral penetration length, and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a form factor <span class="math inline">\(\sim 1\)</span>. This effect increases the value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_c\)</span> needed for a bifurcation: <span class="math display">\[n_o \,&gt;\, \frac{c\nu_{ii}}{\sqrt{\epsilon} \langle \sigma_{cx} v \rangle} \frac{\rho_{pi}}{\ell_n}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>These two conditions provide limits on both electron and neutral particle densities (Eqs. 4.14 and 4.15)</p></li>
<li><p>Neutrals were also found to increase the time for a transition to take place. The paper also considered the effects of an impurity ion.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The same authors have also related the neutral population to the nature of the wall materials, showing that the condition for H-mode can be written as: <span class="math display">\[P(v_f)r_f \,&lt;\, \left[\frac{\langle \sigma_{ion} v \rangle n_e + \langle \sigma_{cx} v \rangle n_i}{\langle \sigma_{recomb} v \rangle n_e + (\nu_i \rho_{pi} / \ell_{recomb})}\right] \frac{\nu_i}{\langle \sigma_{cx} v \rangle n_i} \frac{\rho_{pi}}{\ell_{recomb}}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span> is the reflection coefficient of fast neutrals at the wall; <span class="math inline">\(P(v_f)\)</span> is the probability that the neutral has a velocity <span class="math inline">\(v_f\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{ion}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{cx}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{recomb}\)</span> are the cross-sections for ionization, charge exchange, and recombination of neutrals, respectively; and <span class="math inline">\(\ell_{recomb}\)</span> is the mean-free path for recombination.</p></li>
<li><p>Since <span class="math inline">\(r_f\)</span> is higher for wall materials with higher <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, this could explain why these mitigate against H-mode.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In [138], neutrals were investigated deeper at the X-point. It was found to lead to an increase in the effective collision freq for ion-orbit loss.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For a set of parameters, there is a critical value for the neutral density near the X-point for a transition: thus 'condensed' neutrals can trigger H-mode, which is consistent with experiment. It can be written: <span class="math display">\[\xi \,&lt;\, \frac{d_o \left(\frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{\nu_{*i}}\right)^3 \exp\left(\frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{\nu_{*i}}\right)}{2 \left(\frac{1}{4} + \sqrt{\nu_{*i}}\right)^{3/4} \left(\frac{3}{2} + \sqrt{\nu_{*i}}\right)} \,\equiv\, \xi_c, ~~~~~~~~~~ d_o \,=\, n_o^{main}\langle \sigma_{cx} v \rangle \frac{1 + 2q^2}{\sqrt{\epsilon} \omega_{bi} q^2}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\xi = \nu_{in_o}(X) / \omega_{bi}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{in_o}(X)\)</span> as the ion-neutral collision freq at the X-point and <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{bi}\)</span> as the ion bounce freq.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Shaing and Hsu [139] considered charge exchange losses of poloidal momentum in the ion-orbit-loss model. They found the critical parameter is: <span class="math display">\[\hat{\nu} \,\equiv\, \frac{n_o \langle \sigma_{cx} v \rangle R q}{V_{Th,i}}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Xiao et al [140] investigated the effect of charge exchange on ion orbits. They found that a negative value of <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> produces an inward ion mobility so that a positive bias helps H-mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>The opposite bias is less helpful, relying on detrapping and compressing of passing particle orbits.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stringer-spin-up">4.1.3 <em>Stringer Spin-up</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Pfirsch-Schlüter transport can drive a poloidal spin-up. This mechanism is damped by the magnetic pumping which exceeds the drive, so that no spin-up is predicted by neoclassical theory.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, Hassam et al [70] has proposed, in reaction to higher observed transport, a 'spontaneous poloidal spin-up' associated with anomalous transport which is not constant on a flux surface. Balancing this drive against the damping from magnetic pumping gives a threshold: <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{n r} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}(n r \widetilde{v}_r) + \epsilon \frac{1 + 2q^2}{q^2} \gamma_{MP} \,&lt;\, 0\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{MP}\)</span> represents the magnetic pumping and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{v}_r = v_r - \langle v_r \rangle\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(v_r\)</span> as the radial particle flow velocity and the angled bracketed one as a flux surface average.</p></li>
<li><p>A simplified condition can be deduced for the onset of the poloidal flow instability, by <span class="math inline">\(v_r\)</span> represented by a diffusive term and a pinch term that is constant on a flux surface. Also, if we assume <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{MP} \propto \nu_{ii}\)</span>, then: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\epsilon}{q^2} (1 + 2q^2) \nu_{ii} \,\lessapprox\, \delta D \left(\frac{n^{\prime\prime}}{n} + \frac{n^\prime}{n r}\right)\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Hassam and Antonsen [142] have extended this to include toroidally directed, poloidally asymmetric momentum sources, but did not include diamagnetic flows or gyro-viscosity.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>McCarthy et al [143] did an analytic and numerical investigation; they noted that if turbulent velocities are comparable to diamagnetic ones, then the Stringer spin-up effect is greater than the Reynolds stress by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(L_n^3 / R \rho_s^2\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Their model was toroidally axisymmetric but included a primitive SOL with a particle sink; a flux consisting of a poloidally asymmetric diffusive part and a pinch, and flow damping from magnetic pumping were also included.</p></li>
<li><p>Strong magnetic pumping is taken to correspond with L-mode, when it's found that poloidal flow balances the diamagnetic velocity, as in neoclassical theory.</p></li>
<li><p>For the case of low magnetic pumping, large flows in the opposite direction to the diamagnetic velocity develop, with a shear flow scale length (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{e,mfp}\)</span> is the electron mean-free path and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_e\)</span> is the electron Larmor radius): <span class="math display">\[L_v \,\sim\, \left(\frac{a \rho_e}{L_n \lambda_{e, mfp}}\right)^{1/4} L_n\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The L-H transition would therefore be expected to relate to a change of collisionality.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The effects of a divertor X-point geometry were considered by Strauss [144] using a dissipative reduced MHD model with viscous stresses in which poloidal variations are opposed by sound wave propagation. He found that the condition for spin up was: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\chi_\perp}{L_p^2} \, \widetilde{G} \,&gt;\, \frac{B_\theta}{B} \frac{C_s}{r}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> is the thermal diffusivity and <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{G}\)</span> is a form factor representing the poloidal variations of the geometry.

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="neoclassical-flows">4.1.4 <em>Neoclassical Flows</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Poloidal viscous forces in neoclassical theory produce a poloidal ion flow proportional to the ion temperature gradient: <span class="math display">\[V_{\theta,i} \,=\, \frac{k}{e B} \frac{\text{d}T_i}{\text{d}r}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> depends on the ion collisionality <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{*i}\)</span>. This results in a negative <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>, observed experimentally.</p></li>
<li><p>Plasma microturbulence is expected to produce an 'anomalous' viscosity and inertia and this might affect the poloidal momentum balance equations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Rozhansky and Tendler [145] have taken these into account to derive an equation for the poloidal flow which balances the neoclassical visc. with the anomalous visc. and inertia, excluding toroidal flow.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The neoclassical terms dominates for low edge temperature gradients, which means the equation has a low poloidal flow solution (L-mode).</p></li>
<li><p>For higher edge temperature, the poloidal flow is dominated by the anomalous terms which predicts a much higher flow velocity (H-mode). The transition condition: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\text{d}^2 T_i}{\text{d}r^2} \,\gtrapprox\, \sqrt{\pi} \,\epsilon q\, \frac{n(a) C_s \tau_p}{\bar{n} a^2 (1 + 2q^2)} \frac{\text{d}T_i}{\text{d}r}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau_p\)</span> is the particle confinement time, <span class="math inline">\(n(a)\)</span> is the edge density, and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{n}\)</span> is the average density.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The role of sheared radial electric field associated with the flow (4.23) in suppressing particle diffusivity was investigated by Rozhansky [146,147]. In theirs, there is a steep drop in the diffusion coefficient when the shear suppression parameter reaches a critical value. The shear suppression parameter: <span class="math display">\[\kappa \,=\, \rho_{pi}^2 \frac{\text{d}^2 (\ln n)}{\text{d}r^2}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The steep drop in the diffusion coefficient is most easily satisfied at the edge, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is smallest. The resulting continuity equation is completed by a condition on the flux from the core and a boundary condition at the separatrix, which can represent the SOL.</p></li>
<li><p>They found a L-H transition can be triggered by a change in the core density gradient; the flux must exceed a critical value which increase <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> and decreases with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The transition front propagates faster than any diffusion time, and shows hysteresis.</p></li>
<li><p>Introducing time scales <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1\)</span> for core changes due to the formation of the barrier and <span class="math inline">\(\tau_2\)</span> for the response of the SOL, this model can cause dithering.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The sensitivity of <span class="math inline">\(\kappa\)</span> to the density profile means that the transition can be triggered by pellet injection, adiabatic compression, and changes in the SOL.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hinton [149] invoked the velocity (4.23) to develop a bif. model for the transition by retaining the collisionality dependence of <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, the parallel visc., in the Pfirsh-Schlüter regime and keeping only contributions to <span class="math inline">\(V_{\theta,i}^\prime\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(T_i^\prime\)</span>. He used a transport model: <span class="math display">\[\chi \,=\, \chi_0 + \frac{\chi_1}{1 + \alpha V_{\theta,i}^{\prime \gamma}}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\chi_0\)</span> is residual H-mode thermal diffusivity, <span class="math inline">\(\chi_1\)</span> is L-mode diffusivity. The value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> can be chosen to reflect the BDT criterion, equation (2.30), for, say, drift wave turbulence, and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is some parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>This form leads to a transport flux which exhibits a maximum as a function of <span class="math inline">\(T_i^\prime\)</span> when the heat flux reaches a critical value; this allows a bif. to an 'H-mode' state with higher <span class="math inline">\(T_i^\prime\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Global solutions of the transport equations give an edge region of steep gradients whose radial extent is determined by where the heat flux from the core just exceeds the critical value.

</ul>
<h4 id="turbulent-reynolds-stress-and-viscosity">4.1.5 <em>Turbulent Reynolds Stress and Viscosity</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>The turbulence itself can drive flows through Reynolds stress [150].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The non-ambipolar electron transport from [69] can be considered (for the alternate view of turbulent torque coming from the MHD dynamo [151]) since it corresponds to a radial current which can produce a torque.</p></li>
<li><p>[72] calculated the effects of the turbulent Reynolds stress; they found only turbulence which supports radially propagating waves is able to drive rotation (<em>e.g.</em> drift wave turbulence).</p>
<ul>
<li>However, since flow shear can itself lead to this propagation, this can be amplified for other types of turbulence such as resistive interchanges [152].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The turbulence should be radially inhomogeneous, which tends to limit rotation to the plasma edge where either</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>density and temp. gradients are sufficiently steep that they have a significant variation across a radial correlation length of turbulence or...</p></li>
<li><p>the radial correlation length is cut off by the plasma boundary.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>No detailed calculations (as of this review) of the resulting steady-state flow have been done and no bif. condition is evident.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Because the turbulence to generate a Reynolds stress is directional, it occurs most readily at the plasma edge (supported by experiments [153]) and exists over a width <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> related to the radial mode structure of the turbulence.</p></li>
<li><p>This width is likely to be microscopic (such as <span class="math inline">\(\rho_i\)</span>) in the cylindrical approx., the theory of edge ballooning modes show that it could be larger in toroidal geometry.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Particularly, for drift wave or ion temp. gradient turbulence, one expects <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \sim \rho_i^{2/3} a^{1/3}\)</span> [154,155].</p>
<ul>
<li>Indirect measurements of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> on JET, based on the pedestal height and the assumption that the steep edge gradient is at the ideal MHD ballooning limit, are broadly consistent with this. It also offers an explanation of the isotope scaling of the pedestal temperature [20].</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(\eta_i\)</span> (ion temp gradient) driven mode is a strong candidate for the instability responsible for the L-mode anomalous transport [159].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Considering a slab model, [160] have demonstrated that a radial electric field gradient has a strong stabilizing influence on the <span class="math inline">\(\eta_i\)</span> mode and might explain the improvement in transport observed in H-mode, although it could not explain the origin of the radial field.</p></li>
<li><p>Later, the same authors [161] calculated the turbulent viscosity resulting from the non-linearly saturated <span class="math inline">\(\eta_i\)</span> instability. They obtained the result that this anomalous viscosity increases with radial electric field shear to some critical value beyond which it fails. This allows for the picture of H-mode as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some drive (<em>i.e.</em> momentum source) spins up the plasma in a continuous way to give an equilibrium flow determined by the balance between the drive and the anomalous viscous damping.</p></li>
<li><p>At some critical value of the drive, the radial electric field derivative reaches the critical value <span class="math inline">\(E_{r,crit}^\prime\)</span> where the viscous damping is max.: <span class="math display">\[E_{r,crit}^\prime \,=\, 2.02\times 10^4 B \sqrt{T_e / A_i} ~ \tau^{-0.77} \, L_n^{0.7} \, L_{T_i}^{-0.26} \, L_s^{-1.44} ~ \text{V m}^{-2}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is in T, <span class="math inline">\(T_e\)</span> in eV, and lengths are in m. This is just a prediction.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors postulate a smaller 'background' viscous damping which increases linearly with the electric field gradient and does not possess a max.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>At the critical point, the plasma jumps to the part of the curve representing background viscosity, which then determines the radial electric field in H-mode. The result corresponds to a flow shear scaling like Eq. (2.28).</p></li>
<li><p>The improvement in confinement results from the stabilization of the <span class="math inline">\(\eta_i\)</span> mode with the sudden increase in the electric field gradient. The power threshold corresponds to the point at which the critical electric field is reached, estimated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Two mechanisms may be considered for the momentum input to balance the turbulent viscosity: ion-orbit loss as [68] and a NBI source.</p></li>
<li><p>The balance of the momentum source <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and the turbulent viscosity gives the following, with <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> as the plasma volume, and <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> as a form factor assumed to be a function of only <span class="math inline">\(E_r^{\prime}\)</span> and represents a variation of the turbulent viscosity with <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[M \,\sim\, \frac{n T_e V \rho_s}{L_n^2} \, H\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Neglecting the poloidal rotation (so that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> poloidal flow is balanced by the diamagnetic poloidal flow) and assuming <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> to be given by the ion-orbit-loss mechanism, gives a condition that corresponds to a minimum collisionality: <span class="math display">\[f \, v_{*i}^{1/2} \, \gtrapprox \, \frac{\rho_s a}{L_n^2}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>This condition results in a power threshold assuming forms for the scaling of temps and the fraction of fast particles <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> with power.</p></li>
<li><p>For NBI sources, we can assume <span class="math inline">\(M \propto P\)</span> and obtain: <span class="math display">\[P \, \gtrapprox \, P_{Th} \,\sim\, \frac{n T V \rho_s C_s}{L_n^2}\]</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This theory also allows for a smooth transition. If the <span class="math inline">\(\eta_i\)</span> mode is completely stabilized by <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span> before the max in the anomalous viscosity is reached, the no spontaneous spin-up of the plasma occurs and the threshold power corresponds to that power which provides sufficient radial electric field gradient to stabilize the <span class="math inline">\(\eta_i\)</span> mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>The opposite case has a bifurcation-type H-mode with the spontaneous creation of the radial electric field.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="transport-bifurcation-theories">4.2 <em>Transport Bifurcation Theories</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>In transport bif. theories, the transport suppression from <span class="math inline">\(V_E^\prime\)</span> is determined by <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span> arising from <span class="math inline">\(p_i^\prime\)</span> through radial force balance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Practically, these are closely related to [149], where <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span> is driven by the neoclassical <span class="math inline">\(V_{\theta,i}\)</span> equation (4.23)._</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Bifurcation becomes possible when the sources of energy and particles can drive sufficient gradients.</p></li>
<li><p>When the poloidal and toroidal flows can be neglected, the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> velocity is given by: <span class="math display">\[V_E \,=\, = -\frac{1}{n_i e B} \frac{\text{d}p_i}{\text{d}r}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This expression is correct if standard neoclassical theory is valid at the edge and when the ion temp gradient is neglected. However, the inclusion of orbit-squeezing effects which result from the existence of a radial gradient in the radial electric field can lead to significant poloidal rotation (see [135]).</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of orbit-squeezing, <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span> would be suppressed by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(S = 1 - m_i E_r^\prime / (e B_{\theta}^2)\)</span>, describing the orbit-squeezing, and leads to a mod of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in Eq. (4.26)._</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Using the above eq, the particle and energy fluxes can be expressed solely in terms of density and pressure gradients (and the two parameters). Particle and energy conservation then yield expressions for the fluxes in terms of the heat and particle sources [162]. The resulting system can be solved to determine pressure and temp profiles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For a given particle flux <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> and heat flux <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> less than a critical value, only one solution exists for the ion density and pressure gradient pair, both of which are low (L-mode).</p></li>
<li><p>When <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is above the critical value, the solution jumps to the high gradient solution, interpreted as H-mode. It is easiest to access H-mode at the plasma edge where <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is largest.</p></li>
<li><p>A threshold condition is given that corresponds to the product of fluxes, where <span class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_1\)</span> are H- and L-mode particle diffusivities, respectively, and <span class="math inline">\(\chi_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\chi_1\)</span> are the corresponding thermal diffusivities: <span class="math display">\[(q\Gamma)_{crit} \,=\, \frac{9}{16} \frac{D_1 \chi_1}{\sqrt{3\alpha}} \left(1 + \frac{4 D_0}{3 D_1}\right) \left(1 + \frac{4 \chi_0}{3 \chi_1}\right), ~~~~~ \text{(normalized)}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Applying the condition at the edge means that <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> becomes the total input power per area and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> can be calculated from the source resulting from the neutrals diffusing in from the edge and becoming ionized inside the plasma.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If one interprets <span class="math inline">\(D_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\chi_0\)</span> as the neoclassical diffusivities and <span class="math inline">\(D_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\chi_1\)</span> as anomalous diffusivities, the above eq complicated scaling for a power threshold, even in the limit that the neoclassical diffusivities are neglected.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The model also depends on the model which is chosen for recycling.</p></li>
<li><p>As a note, bifurcations are only possible when <span class="math inline">\(\gamma &gt; 1/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_1/ D_0 &gt; 2\gamma / (\gamma - 1/2)^2\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Therefore, a bif. transition is expected where the edge transport is dominated by turbulent processes, and a smooth transition would occur where there is more neoclassical transport.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This work has been extended to include poloidal and toroidal flows, as well as density and temp gradients [62,163].

<li><p>For transitions, if <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is expressed in terms of the edge recycling particle flux, then the recycling coefficient <span class="math inline">\(r &lt; 0.98\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The width of the edge transport barrier is <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \propto \ell_i \ln(P)\)</span>, meaning it is only weakly varying with additional power and proportional to the neutral ionization depth. The barrier is formed in a few milliseconds: <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \tau \sim (\Delta / a)^2 \tau_p\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(\tau_p\)</span> as particle conf time.</p></li>
<li><p>It also addresses the generation of poloidal flows by biased probes or ion-orbit-loss mechanisms. The threshold power reduces when $B_(V_/ r) &gt; 0, which is expected for ion-orbit loss [163].</p></li>
<li><p>The condition for orbit-squeezing to produce a large poloidal flow <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{pi} / L_p &gt; 1\)</span> typically exceeds that needed for a transition arising from the normal pressure gradient contributions to <span class="math inline">\(S_\perp\)</span> in (4.34)._ [164]</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[165] have given a simplified generic model for the transition based on ion temperature gradient turbulence and allowing for rotational shear stabilization.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the increase in rotational shear stabilization with <span class="math inline">\(\nabla T\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, which allows for a bif. at a normalized power <span style="color:red">(4.35)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[166] considered situations with RF electron heating where the preferential loss of hot electrons can generate sheared radial electric fields.</p>

<h3 id="phase-transition-models">4.3 <em>Phase-Transition Models</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>'Phase-transition' models evolve in time a set of spatially-averaged, coupled equations for the turbulence level, the driving gradients, and the consequent radial electric field, with transport coefficients responding to the fluctuations and the radial electric field (or flow) shear [120].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If turbulence dynamics time scale is removed, they collapse to the transport bif type.</p></li>
<li><p>A turbulent dynamo effect amplifies the flow shear until the fluctuations are self-regulated as the flow shear suppression exerts itself.</p></li>
<li><p>The threshold power follows from the condition that the energy input rate in the absence of flow shear exceeds neoclassical or charge exchange poloidal flow damping.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[167,168] investigated the interaction between flows and turbulence in a generic system of equations. The fluctuation energy <span class="math inline">\(E = |\widetilde{n}_k / n |^2\)</span> satisfies:_ <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{2} \frac{\text{d}E}{\text{d}t} \,=\, \gamma_0 E - \alpha_1 E^2 - \alpha_2 U E\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\gamma_0\)</span> is the linear growth rate, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span> is the nonlinear damping due to coupling to other helicities, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_2 U \equiv \alpha_2 V_E^{\prime 2}\)</span> represents the effect of a sheared <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> flow in stabilizing the instability.</p></li>
<li><p>The sheared <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> flow itself is governed by the competition between the Reynold stress drive due to the fluctuations and damping due to the parallel viscosity <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> since: <span class="math display">\[V_E \,=\, -\frac{e}{B} \,=\, V_\theta - \frac{\rho_s C_s}{p_i} \frac{\text{d}p_i}{\text{d}r}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>This leads to <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{\text{d}U}{\text{d}t} \,=\, -\mu U + \alpha_3 U E\)</span>, where the ion pressure gradient contribution is dropped for simplicity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span>'s can be estimated for different types of turbulence. This system forms a 'predator-prey' model, in which the fluctuation intensity <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the prey to the shear flow U (predator), and depends only on the parameters <span class="math inline">\(a = \alpha_3 / \alpha_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b = \mu / \gamma_0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two fixed points: <span class="math inline">\(E = \gamma_0 / \alpha_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(U = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E = \mu / \alpha_3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(U = (\gamma_0 - \alpha_1 \mu / \alpha_3) / \alpha_2\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is stable if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_0 &gt; \alpha_1 \mu / \alpha_3\)</span> and can be identified as H-mode.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For a generic drift wave model, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_0 \sim k_\theta \rho_s C_s / L_T\)</span>. Power balance at the edge implies <span class="math inline">\(L_T^{-1} \sim P / (n T a R \chi)\)</span>, which give the bif condition <span style="color:red">(4.39)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A scaling for $_1 can be obtained by assuming a decorrelation freq of order <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{*}\)</span>, a radial mode width of order <span class="math inline">\(\rho_s\)</span>, and taking <span class="math inline">\(\chi \sim C_s \rho_s^2 / L_n\)</span>, giving <span style="color:red">(4.40)</span>. Furthermore [167,168] states that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_3 \sim C_s / L_s\)</span> for generic drift wave turbulence, giving: <span class="math display">\[P_{th} \,=\, \mu n T L_s a R\]</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A more direct estimate of the bif condition [167,169] leads to a critical value of the local quantity, where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta r \sim \rho_i L_s / L_n \approx 2\)</span> cm: <span class="math display">\[\lambda \,=\, \frac{V_{Th,i}}{L_s \mu} \left(\frac{\Delta r}{L_n}\right)^2\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>This gives a critical value of <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{*i}\)</span> in the banana region (where <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{*} &lt; 1\)</span> in (4.42))and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{*}\)</span> in the plateau regime (where <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{*} &gt; 1\)</span>) and is more easily satisfied in a divertor config where <span class="math inline">\(L_s\)</span> is smaller.</p></li>
<li><p>This model has also been extended to include an equation for the evolution of the ion pressure gradient and its contribution to <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span> [170].</p></li>
<li><p>This leads to a L-H transition (first-order phase transition) in <span class="math inline">\(V_E^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> as a function of heat flux <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. However, there is a 2nd, later transition to zero fluctuations.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The inclusion of <span class="math inline">\(p_i^\prime\)</span> (ion pressure gradient) leads to a preferred direction for a seed radial electric field gradient <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span>. Near the transition, the <span class="math inline">\(V_\theta\)</span> contribution to <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> dominates due to <span class="math inline">\(p_i^\prime\)</span> and conversely for <span class="math inline">\(P \gg P_{Th}\)</span>; thus <span class="math inline">\(P_{Th}\)</span> is unaffected.</p></li>
<li><p>After the transition, the fluctuations are quenched, and therefore, the drive for <span class="math inline">\(V_{\theta}^\prime\)</span> vanishes so that only the <span class="math inline">\(p_i^\prime\)</span> contribution remains.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A rapid power ramp compresses the time duration of the sheared flow generation phase, which may render it unobservable.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, the transition time becomes logarithmically singular at the transition point <span class="math inline">\(P \sim P_{th}\)</span>, which is like a 2nd-order phase transition, <em>i.e.</em> there are jumps in temporal gradients of quantities, not in the quantities themselves.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>An elaboration of the model [171] is to introduce an external torque <span class="math inline">\(T_{ext}\)</span> to drive <span class="math inline">\(V_\theta\)</span>, which can be done by a biased limiter, probe, or RF waves. It results in a reduction of the critical power: <span class="math display">\[P_{Th} \,=\, P_{Th}^0 - K T_{ext}^{2/3}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Another extension [169,172] was made to describe the radial propagation of the L-H transition front by including radial diffusion effects in the equations for fluctuation energy and poloidal velocity shear. The velocity of propagation is give, with <span class="math inline">\(D_1\)</span> as the diffusion coeff and <span class="math inline">\(L_p\)</span> as the pressure gradient length in L-mode: <span class="math display">\[V_f \,=\, \frac{2D_1}{L_p} \sqrt{\frac{P}{P_{Th}} - 1}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>With the 3-eq model described, one obtains a propagating form for <span class="math inline">\(P \gtrapprox P_{Th}\)</span>, but at $P P_{Th}, there is no propagation and the fluctuations collapse uniformly everywhere.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[173] have introduced neutrals, which increase the effective damping of <span class="math inline">\(V_\theta\)</span> by charge exchange, decrease the effective energy flux through charge exchanged and ionization, and provide a particle source. The local particle and heat fluxes act as order parameters._</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a model that neglects <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_\theta\)</span>, the bif condition is symmetric in particle flux per area from the core <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_c\)</span> and the neutral influx <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_o\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\Gamma_c + \Gamma_o \,&gt;\, \frac{n k_\theta \rho_s C_s}{4}, ~~~~~~~ \text{for drift wave turbulence: } k_\theta \rho_s \leq 1\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>This more-complete model has 4 parameters, one being <span class="math inline">\(g_1 = q / T\Gamma\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It was found that the threshold particle flux (the above eq) decreases with <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in the absence of neutrals but increases in their presence.</p></li>
<li><p>If the energy losses in the edge due to ionization and charge exchange compete with the core heat flux (<span class="math inline">\(g_1 &lt; 1\)</span>), then increasing the neutral density lowers the threshold because <span class="math inline">\(n^\prime\)</span> dominates <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> and the neutral source increases <span class="math inline">\(n^\prime\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This case is like the simple model (4.46); it has the implication that H-modes with <span class="math inline">\(L_T &gt; L_n\)</span> are more stable against changes in <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_o\)</span> inducing a back transition.</p></li>
<li><p>For cases <span class="math inline">\(g_1 \sim 1\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(n^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T^\prime\)</span> contributions to <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> cancel and there is a max in the threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>The threshold is raised if <span class="math inline">\(T_i / T_e\)</span> is decreased, so that edge electron heating is unfavorable.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The phase-transition model can be elaborated to obtain a position and width for the barrier. The location of the transition can be obtained from the Maxwell construction [75] and in a time-dependent calculation, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, the radial position of the barrier at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, propagates as: <span class="math display">\[x \,=\, \sqrt{\frac{D\,t\,(\Gamma - \Gamma_M)}{\Gamma_M}}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is the diffusion coeff, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> the flux, and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_M\)</span> is the Maxwell flux.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of an edge neutral source, [174] deduced that the barrier (pedestal) width is: <span class="math display">\[\Delta_{ped} \,=\, \sqrt{\frac{D}{\nu_{ion}}} \, F\left(\frac{\Gamma_o}{\Gamma_M}\right)\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\nu_{ion}\)</span> is the ionization rate for neutral atoms at the plasma surface and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a weak function of the incident neutral flux <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_o\)</span> that provides an ionization source at the plasma edge.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The basis for these phase-transition models have been investigated using non-linear simulations of resistive pressure gradient driven turbulence in [175].</p>
<ul>
<li>It is found that a strong cancellation between turbulent Reynolds stress drive for <span class="math inline">\(V(\theta)\)</span> and damping due to turbulent viscosity means that the transition can only occur at low fluctuation amplitudes near marginal stability. The reduction in transport in H-mode is partly due to the changed phase relationship between fluctuations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The possibility of active control of the transition is done in [176], where it is shown that low-freq poloidal flows are more weakly damped by neoclassical viscosity than are static ones, which could allow the driving stabilization oscillating poloidal flows.</p></li>
<li><p>Other ideas [177], they develop a dynamical model to describe electrostatic resistive pressure gradient driven turbulence in slab geometry. This consists of 3 ODE's describing the evolution of electrostatic potential, plasma flow, and fluctuation energy.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is derived from energy balance by modelling the transfer and dissipative terms, with the energy input as an order parameter (rather than having <span class="math inline">\(p_i^\prime\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>The transition is triggerd by an increase in <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span>, leading to a decrease in the neoclassical poloidal viscosity that opposes Reynolds stress.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the transition to occur, the edge diffusivity must exceed the viscosity (<span class="math inline">\(T_i \geq 50 - 100\)</span> eV), giving Eq <span style="color:red">(4.49)</span> as a power threshold. The time for transition is usually <span class="math inline">\(\sim 50 \mu\)</span>s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>At low densities (<em>i.e.</em> banana regime), one finds a 1st-order phase transition showing hysteresis.</p></li>
<li><p>For higher densities (plateau), a 2nd-order phase transition occurs. This model was completed and verified by [178].</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[179] is a phase-transition model called the edge turbulent layer (ETL) model.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A transition from zero plasma flow to a finite flow with reduced turbulence occurs a critical <span class="math inline">\(\nabla T\)</span>, by solving a Lorenz-like system:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is done by solving a Lorenz-like system of equations for velocity shear, turbulent kinetic energy, thermal energy, and the temperature profile, with the incident heat flux and temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_b\)</span> (temperature gradient across the turbulent layer) at the core-edge interface.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The transition can only occur if the poloidal viscosity varies inversely with temperature. This requires <span class="math inline">\(T &gt; \sqrt{0.7 n q R} \, Z(\text{eff})^2 \epsilon^{-3/4} \times 10^-2\)</span> keV, typically 0.26 keV.</p></li>
<li><p>This bif corresponds to the transition and can be expressed as a critical power <span class="math inline">\(P_{th} = 1.23 \pi^2 n T_b R a L_t \nu_i\)</span>. It can be fitted to: <span class="math display">\[P_{th} \,\propto\, n B^2 \left(1 + \frac{c}{B n}\right)\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>This ETL model can be used to provide a boundary condition for a core transport code [180]. The bif occurs at a critical value of <span class="math inline">\(T_b\)</span> and on a much faster time scale that <span class="math inline">\(\tau_E\)</span>.</p></li>
