<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>ASDEX found an empirical law for the heating required for H-mode (with some nuance): <span class="math display">\[P_{h} \,=\, 0.04 \, \bar{n}_e \, B \, S\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Above, in MW, with <span class="math inline">\(\bar{n_e}\)</span> as the line-averaged electron density in units of <span class="math inline">\(10^{20}\)</span> m<span class="math inline">\(^{-3}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as the magnetic field strength, and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as the plasma surface area.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>L-H transition requires less heating when the magnetic field config. is such that the ion-<span class="math inline">\(\nabla B\)</span> drift direction is towards a single null formed by the divertor geometry, rather than away from it.</p></li>
<li><p>Wagner [11] assumes, for the above empirical law, that the transition occurs with the ion diamagnetic velocity achieves some critical value: <span class="math display">\[V_{*i} \,=\, -\frac{1}{n e B} \frac{\text{d}p_i}{\text{d}r} \,=\, V_{crit}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Since the transition is an edge phenomenon, it's possible an addition atomic physics parameter is involved. This means one cannot scale the plasma temperature.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="i-local-edge-parameters">(i) <em>Local edge parameters</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Also, since the transition occurs at the edge, one would expect that the condition for it to occur can be expressed in terms of local parameter one would expect that the condition for it to occur can be expressed in terms of local parameters and length scales of the edge.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Models are usually expressed in terms of such quantities, or equivalent dimensionless parameters such as the normalized Larmor radius <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{*} \,=\, \rho_i \,/\, a\)</span>, collisionality, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of local plasma parameters, hysteresis is less obvious, but the critical temperature responds to the ion-<span class="math inline">\(\nabla B\)</span> drift in the same manner as <span class="math inline">\(P_h\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ii-spatial-and-temporal-characteristics">(ii) <em>Spatial and temporal characteristics</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>How the edge region scales is a potential test of theories.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Transition usually occurs at sub-millisecond or microsecond scales, with a slower evolution in the millisecond range.</p></li>
<li><p>The temporal sequence of events for testing the theory: the creation of steep electric field gradients, suppression of turbulence, and steepening of density and temperature profiles.</p></li>
<li><p>It is tackled in 3 different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dimensional analysis, with confinement properties and energy balance involving cross-field transport into the SOL.</p></li>
<li><p>Stabilization of instabilities to cause transport in L-mode</p></li>
<li><p><strong>!!</strong> The mechanisms producing bifurcations, such as electric fields and flows. SEE REFERENCES!</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>While the stabilization of some linear instability responsible for transport may be part of it, it is unlikely to account for the rapid changes usually observed in the L-H transition since stability criteria usually depend on parameters that change on a transport timescale.</p></li>
<li><p>The theories are divided into 3 basic groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Those that rely on achieving conditions of plasma parameters for the stabilization of particular instabilities or suppression of the associated turbulence. They are then subdivided into the edge of the core and those in the SOL.</p></li>
<li><p>Those that rely on the suppression of turbulent transport by sheared radial electric fields or plasma flow, further classified by the physical processes that drive and limit these quantities.</p></li>
<li><p>Those that are considered miscellaneous mechanisms, such as effects arising from divertor action, neoclassical theory, and particular transport models that don't fit above; for example, the role of neoclassical drifts.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>All of this is summarized in two tables in the appendix.</p></li>

<h2 id="theoretical-considerations">2. Theoretical Considerations</h2>
<h3 id="a-dimensional-analysis">2.1 <em>A dimensional analysis</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>In terms of plasma physics, expect to be able to represent the L-H transition condition by <span class="math inline">\(\rho \propto \beta^x \nu^y\)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="edge-power-balance">2.2 <em>Edge power balance</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A more consistent approach to obtaining the transition condition is to used a local edge power balance to determine radial length scales, relating to the SOL width <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can relate the outflow of power into the SOL to a local model for the heat flux across the magnetic field <span class="math inline">\(q_\perp\)</span> at the edge: <span class="math display">\[P \propto a R n q_\perp \sim a R n \chi_\perp T / \Delta\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The power into the SOL must be transported along the field lines to the divertor plates (<span class="math inline">\(q_\parallel\)</span> is heat flux parallel to the magnetic field): <span class="math display">\[P \sim \frac{q_{\parallel} \Delta a}{q}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Some assumptions are needed for the perp and parallel heat transport in the SOL: give estimates when perp transport is either Bohm or gyro-Bohm and when parallel transport is dominated by either collisional diffusion or by flow at sound speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Balance perp and parallel heat flows in the SOL give: <span class="math display">\[\Delta(SOL) \sim \sqrt{\frac{n T \chi_\perp R q}{q_\parallel}}\]</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The results of taking each assumption is given by Eqs. (2.24) through (2.27).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-shear-flow-paradigm">2.3 <em>The shear flow paradigm</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Sheared radial electric fields reduce turbulent transport by either stabilization of linear modes or through a reduction of turbulence amplitudes, correlation lengths, or a change in phases between the fluctuations responsible for the turbulent transport fluxes.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(V^{\prime}_E\)</span> denotes the radial derivative of the equilibrium <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}\)</span> velocity, <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A limit on sheared rotation was found: <span class="math inline">\(\omega_s &gt; \omega_t\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\omega_s = k_\theta \Delta r V_E^\prime\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta r\)</span> as the radial correlation length and <span class="math inline">\(k_\theta\)</span> as a characteristic poloidal wavenumber of the turbulence.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\omega_t = 4D / (\Delta r)^2\)</span> as the diffusive scattering rate, with <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> being the turbulent diffusivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Turbulent eddies are torn apart by the differing <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}\)</span> flows at different radial locations within the eddy, shown in Fig. 7.</p></li>
<li><p>Further analysis of a model equation showed that turbulence suppression occurs when <span class="math inline">\(|\omega_t| &lt; |\omega_s|\)</span>, which is known as the Biglari-Diamond-Terry (BDT) criterion, which can also be written as: <span class="math display">\[V_E^\prime &gt; (\Delta r k_\theta \tau_c)^{-1}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau_c\)</span> is the turbulent decorrelation time, which can be considered on the order of the inverse of the diamagnetic frequency.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A more complete expression for <span class="math inline">\(\omega_s\)</span> is shown in Eq. (2.31), where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \phi\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \eta\)</span> are correlation angles for the turbulence around the torus and along the field line, respectively: <span class="math display">\[\omega_s^2 \,=\, (\Delta r)^2 \left[\frac{1}{(\Delta \phi)^2} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(\frac{q V_e}{r}\right)\right)^2 + \frac{1}{(\Delta \eta)^2}\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(\frac{V_\parallel}{q R}\right)\right)^2\right]\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>After some generalizations, and assuming the correlation 'lengths' and electrostatic potential <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> are constant on a flux surface, it can be reduced (the proportionality hold when <span class="math inline">\(\Delta r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \theta\)</span> are fixed): <span class="math display">\[\omega_s \,=\, \frac{R^2 B_\theta^2}{r B_\phi} \left(\frac{\Delta r}{\Delta \theta}\right) \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \psi^2} \,\propto\, R^3\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>When turbulence is isotropic (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta r \sim r\Delta \theta\)</span>), it can be written that (Eq. (2.34)): <span class="math display">\[\omega_s \,=\, \frac{RB_\theta}{B} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{E_r}{RB_\theta}\right)\]</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The curvature of <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> does not have a generic effect on turbulence, but can affect specific instabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>The transport coefficients are taken to be suppressed by the presence of <span class="math inline">\(\omega_s\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[D \,=\, \frac{D_0}{1 + c\left(\frac{\omega_s}{\omega_t}\right)^\gamma}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Another mechanism for reducing transport is the effect of <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span> on the cross-phase of the fluctuations contributing to the transport flux (source [67]).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="radial-electric-fields">2.4 <em>Radial electric fields</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(V_E^\prime\)</span> is determined by the radial electric field <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>, which is then deduced from the radial force balance for any plasma species <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> (Eq. (2.38)): <span class="math display">\[E_r \,=\, -\frac{1}{n_j e_j} \frac{\text{d} p_j}{\text{d} r} + V_{\theta j} B_\phi - V_{\phi j} B_\theta\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(e_j\)</span> is charge, <span class="math inline">\(p_j\)</span> is pressure, <span class="math inline">\(n_j\)</span> is density, and <span class="math inline">\(V_{\theta j}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_{\phi j}\)</span> are the poloidal and toroidal velocities.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, changes in <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> can be associated with changes in <span class="math inline">\(V_{\theta j}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(V_{\phi j}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(p_j^\prime\)</span> (the prime is the radial derivative).</p></li>
<li><p>The ones that vary in the poloidal velocity correspond to bifurcations in the solutions of the poloidal momentum balance equation, requiring a momentum source/torque and sink.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sources: ion-orbit loss, non-ambipolar electron loss, Stringer spin-up due to poloidal asymmetries in turbulent transport, Reynolds stress from turbulence, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Sinks: ion parallel neoclassical viscosity, charge exchange on neutrals, etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Models involving <span class="math inline">\(V_{\phi j}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(p_j^\prime\)</span> depend on sources of particles (neutrals surrounding the plasma, neutral beams), energy (heating), or toroidal momentum (neutral beams) driving <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span> until a transport bifurcation occurs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If one balances <span class="math inline">\(\omega_s\)</span> from Eq. (2.34) using <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> derived from the <span class="math inline">\(p^\prime\)</span> contribution in Eq. (2.38), then the criterion <span class="math inline">\(\omega_s = \gamma_{max}\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{*s} &gt; \rho_{*s,\text{crit}}\)</span>, in which <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{*s,\text{crit}}\)</span> depends on the scaling of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{max}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bifurcations">2.5 <em>Bifurcations</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Bifurcations can take place when the equation has multi-valued or non-monotonic solutions as a function of an 'order' variable, such as density or temperature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-valued solutions cause 'hard' bifurcations. When the solution is merely non-monotonic, it is a 'soft bif., also known as a 'first-order phase transition.' When the solution remains monotonic but undergoes a change in slope, it is called a 'second-order phase transition.'</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The poloidal torque balance has the potential to lead to a bif. in poloidal flow, and therefore <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The following section of the paper covers this in significant detail. This includes that the particle flux has a nonlinear dependence on the radial electric field.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The simplest models for the bif. physics are local in radius, but one can introduce effects to determine the radial structure of the bif. layer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A small discussion follows on determining the bif. layer width <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the bif. in <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> arises from <span class="math inline">\(V_\theta\)</span>, it could be that the poloidal gyroradius and viscosity determine it.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it could be set by transport equations for density and temperature, whose gradients drive <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>. (READ)</p></li>

<h2 id="instabilities-and-turbulence-at-the-plasma-edge">3. Instabilities and Turbulence at the Plasma Edge</h2>
<ul>
<li>In this section, some cases where the reduction in transport fluxes resulting from a self-consistent generation of sheared flows will be noted.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="edge-region-of-the-core">3.1 <em>Edge Region of the Core</em></h3>
<h4 id="ideal-mhd-modes">3.1.1 <em>Ideal MHD Modes</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Bishop [77] proposes ideal MHD ballooning mode stability has a role in L-H transitions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>He concludes that stability properties become progressively better in a separatrix configuration in which the X-point position moves into the region of favorable curvature and that a finite edge current allows the possibility of complete stability to both ballooning and interchange modes for surfaces close to the separatrix.</p></li>
<li>This is due partly because regions of zero local magnetic shear are move to regions of favorable curvature.</li>
<li><p>Suggests that the L-H transition occurs well below the simple ballooning limit, Eq. (3.1)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Edge plasma current can also drive instabilities (DUH). The peeling mode occurs when a resonant surface for an ideal external kink mode lies just outside the plasma surface. In cylindrical geometry, this mode is destabilized by a finite plasma current at the edge.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These (mentioned in the paper) properties suggest that L-mode is considered to be unstable to the peeling mode, resulting in a high level of magnetic fluctuations at the tokamak edge and therefore an enhanced thermal diffusivity.</p></li>
<li><p>As heating is increase, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, a parameter, will rise and eventually pass beyond the critical value required for stability; the peeling mode will then switch off and the edge confinement will improve, which can be interpreted as necessary for H-mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether the peeling mode is stabilized as power increases depends on the competition between the rise in <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and the rise in temperature, providing a possible explanation in L-H transitions between large and small tokamaks.</p></li>
<li><p>(Look into context) (iv) H-mode can be accessed by reducing the edge current by current ramp-down and by pellet injection (decreases edge temperature, which increases resistivity).</p></li>

<h2 id="models-involving-sheared-radial-electric-field-and-flows">4. Models Involving Sheared Radial Electric Field and Flows</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It is possible to classify the models by sheared radial electric fields according to the processes generating it: poloidal flow drives and damping, toroidal flows, and transport processes.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, one can separate the models according to whether or not they treat the evolution of gradients and fluctuations on the same footing.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="poloidal-torque-balance">4.1 <em>Poloidal Torque Balance</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Balance of torques driven by radial currents against poloidal viscosity or damping.</p>
<ul>
<li>The balance of these torques can lead to multiple solutions for the poloidal flow (or radial electric field); can be associated with low and high transport, <em>i.e.</em> L- and H-modes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ion-orbit-loss-theories">4.1.1 <em>Ion-Orbit Loss Theories</em></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Earliest model that predicts a bif. in <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>, due to Itoh and Itoh [69].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They used ion-orbit loss at the edge and balanced it against a non-ambipolar electron diffusion to derive an expression for the equilibrium radial electric field.</p></li>
<li><p>The non-ambipolarity comes from the emission of wave momentum which is not absorbed in the plasma but lost in the SOL. <span class="math display">\[\lambda_e \,=\, -\frac{T_e}{T_i} \rho_{pi} \left(\frac{n_e^\prime}{n_e} + c_e \frac{T_e^\prime}{T_e}\right)\]</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(c_e\)</span> is a constant of O(1) that depends on the nature of the microturbulence</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_e &lt; \lambda_c \approx \rho_{pi}^2 \nu_{ii} / (\sqrt{\epsilon} D_e)\)</span>, only one solution exists, which corresponds to a low (negative) electric field.</p></li>
<li><p>As <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_e\)</span> increases to <span class="math inline">\(\approx \lambda_c\)</span>, two new solutions exist with higher <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_e\)</span> increasing beyond <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_c\)</span>, the plasma is forced to jump to the high <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> solution. This is considered equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{*i}\)</span> being below a critical value. <span class="math display">\[\lambda_e = \lambda_c ~~~~\longrightarrow~~~~ \frac{D_e \tau \sqrt{\epsilon}}{\nu_{ii}\rho_{pi} L_n} \,\gtrapprox\, 1\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>When the previous threshold is exceeded, the resulting field is positive, at odds with experimental measurements.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Usually, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_c\)</span> is of order unity, giving <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{pi} / L_n \gtrapprox 1\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(L_n\)</span> is the density gradient length.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A later model [120] found that for a negative radial field <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span>, its radial derivative <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span> flips from being small and positive in L-mode to large and negative in H-mode. This jump is hypothesized to be the confinement improvement and associated reduction in turbulence level at the time of transition. This model also has hysteresis.</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color:red">Another model has the generation of toroidal flow by ion-orbit loss with similar results, with an extension to a situation where additional heating generates energetic electrons, which are then lost due to magnetic field ripple trapping [121,122].</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A bifurcation condition arises, in which <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> signifies 'hot' electrons, $ is the ripple amplitude, and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is plasma volume: <span class="math display">\[\frac{n_h}{n_i}\left(\frac{T_h}{T_i}\right)^{7/2} \,&gt;\, 0.17 \frac{\epsilon^3}{\lambda_h \delta^{3/2}} \sqrt{\frac{m_i}{m_e}} \nu_{*i}^2, ~~~~~~ \lambda_h \,=\, \frac{\rho_{pi} n_h^\prime}{n_h}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>This give a power threshold: <span class="math display">\[P_{th} \,=\, 10\epsilon^2 \frac{T_h \rho_{pi}}{T_i a} \nu_i n_i T_i V\]</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The current diffusive ballooning mode (CDBM) model has been examined [123,124], which is based on a resistive ballooning mode turbulence, but where dissipation arises from renormalized viscosity and current diffusion coefficients associated with electron inertia (supported by simulations of turbulence) [125,126].</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This includes a reduction in the transport for larger <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span>, independent of sign. Using the results from this, the threshold for the L-H transition becomes [127]: <span class="math display">\[\sqrt{\frac{a}{m_i}} \, \frac{m_e}{e^2 B^2} \, \frac{a_0 q^2}{f(s)} \, \frac{|\text{d}T / \text{d}r|^{5/2}}{\rho_{pi} \nu_{ii} T} \,=\, 1\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> is a numerical coefficient and <span class="math inline">\(f(s)\)</span> is a function of magnetic shear <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, depending on the mode structure.</p></li>
<li><p>When this model is incorporated into a transport code which models the self-consistent evolution of <span class="math inline">\(p^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_r^\prime\)</span>, it can produce a stable edge transport barriere [128].</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Model of Shaing and Crume also appealed to ion-orbit loss; they balanced the change in poloidal momentum, resulting from loss of the faster ions in the tail of a Maxwellian velocity dist., against the neoclassical poloidal viscous damping ('magnetic pumping'), which is dominated by slower thermal ions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The result give solutions for the poloidal flow velocity which bifurcates as the temperature is increase: a low velocity (L-mode) and high velocity (H-mode) solution.</p></li>
<li><p>The improvement in confinement is assumed to result from the effect of the sheared flow on the correlation length of the turbulence.</p></li>
<li><p>The threshold conditions again can be expressed as falling below a critical ion collisionality <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{*i}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a constant: <span class="math display">\[\frac{n R q}{\epsilon^{3/2} T_i^2} \,&lt;\, c\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Predictions of this theory include a poloidal spin-up of the plasma, hysteresis, and an associated negative radial field within a region at the plasma edge of width <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\epsilon} \rho_{pi} / \sqrt{s}\)</span>._</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the original theory was based on the assumption that the ions take up a Maxwellian velocity dist., that predicts high collisionality plasmas should not exhibit H-mode. <em>However</em>, the presence of a fast ion source invalidates that assumption.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Shaing and Zhang [130] modified the previous to include stress arising from the interaction of a magnetic field perturbation <span class="math inline">\(b_r\)</span> with the vacuum vessel in the equation for the ion poloidal velocity. Relative to the orbit-loss term, they find an effective stress which can remove the possibility of a bif. in poloidal flow leading to sheared radial electric fields: <span class="math display">\[\pi_{eff} \,=\, \frac{C_A^2 a \omega \tau_W (r_s / r_W)^{2m} (b_r / B)^2}{V_{Th i}^2 w (1 + (\omega\tau_W)^2 [1 - (r_s / r_W)^{2m}]^2)}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is the magnetic island width arising from <span class="math inline">\(b_r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is the frequency in the lab frame, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_W\)</span> is the wall time constant, <span class="math inline">\(r_s\)</span> is the resonant surface for the islands, and <span class="math inline">\(r_W\)</span> is the wall radius.</p></li>
<li><p>This has the consequence that increasing <span class="math inline">\(b_r\)</span> increases <span class="math inline">\(P_{Th}\)</span> for the L-H transition; conversely, for a given <span class="math inline">\(b_r\)</span>, increasing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> assists the transition. Also, the bifurcated flow is smaller.</p></li>
<li><p>The aforementioned effects are significant when <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{eff} \geq 1\)</span>, which can occur typically for <span class="math inline">\(b_r / B \sim 4\times 10^{-4}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Hinton and Kim [131] have demonstrated how to link <span class="math inline">\(E_r\)</span> from the SOL to the core across the separatrix, where a radial current <span class="math inline">\(j_r\)</span> must flow, which allows divertor biasing to affect the core.</p></li>
<li><p>Miyamoto [132] has considered ion-orbit loss in a divertor/separatrix geometry and demonstrated that bifs. in electrostatic potential are possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Complementarily, Krasheninnikov and Yushmanov [133] show that a potential step can increase ion-orbit loss, allowing an unstable growth of potential and a L-H transition.</p></li>
<li><p>Kim et al [134] and Hinton et al [135] noted that orbit squeezing, due to electric field gradients comparable with the ion poloidal Larmor radius, can increase ion poloidal flows, thus modifying the effect of poloidal flow damping.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the same effect reduces the bootstrap current so that the radial field shear can inhibit the bootstrap current drive for MHD instabilities at the plasma edge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Change [136] has examined ion-orbit loss at the X-point, where it is most effective since the poloidal field vanishes there. A critical collisionality depending on the details of the X-point geometry and condition is found, and a layer width <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \sim \bar{\rho_{pi}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\rho_{pi}}\)</span> is an average over the flux surface.</p></li>
