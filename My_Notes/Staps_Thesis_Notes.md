# Notes on _Backstepping control of H-L confinement transition in fusion plasma model_
## Chapter 2: Physics of the confinement transition and H-mode
### 2.1 Order of scales

+ Transport of magnetic flux is the slowest process within a tokamak plasma; therefore, the magnetic field can be treated as a constant background field during transition.

+ Magnetic reconnection (_e.g._ sawtooth instability) occurs on a fast time scale, but is not considered for this thesis.

+ Pressure gradients drive the turbulent modes, giving anomalous transport of particles, energy, and momentum.

	+ Changes in turbulence occur in the smallest of time scales; they are often inferred from fluctuations in density and electric field.

### 2.2 Turbulence
#### 2.2.1 Dynamics

+ The dominant modes are the ion temperature gradient mode and trapped electron mode in a collisionless plasma.

+ Micro-instabilities give drift waves because electrons neutralize fluctuations in finite time.

	+ The coupling of drift waves to other plasma modes yields different types of drift-wave turbulences such as the drift resistive ballooning mode and drift Alfv√©n turbulence.

+ Drift waves are the only type of turbulence able to drive a radial flux and therefore, drift wave turbulence determines the level of edge turbulence and associated transport. Basic model for this:
	$$\frac{\text{d}\mathcal{E}}{\text{d}t} \,=\, \gamma_1 \mathcal{E} - \alpha_{sat}\mathcal{E}^2$$

	+ $\mathcal{E}$ is the turbulence level, $\gamma_1$ is the growth rate, and $\alpha_{sat}$ is the saturation rate._

#### 2.2.2 Flow shear suppression of turbulence

+ A radial shear in plasma flow decorrelates turbulent eddies, which are small compared to the flow length scale. As eddies are extended by the sheared plasma flow, their wave energy is transferred to larger flow structures ad the expense of small turbulent structures:
	$$\frac{\partial V_{\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}}}{\partial x} \,=\, \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(\frac{E_r}{B}\right) \,\approx\, \frac{1}{B_\phi} \frac{\partial E_r}{\partial x}$$

+ Both zonal and mean $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ flow are involved in the transition.

	+ Zonal flows are produced by the shear of Reynolds stress arising from correlated radial and poloidal fluctuations.

		+ Its shear suppresses the drift-wave turbulence, but the mechanism is damped by ion-ion collisions or flow instabilities. Therefore, zonal flows provide a temporary sink of energy, which show their signature before the transition.

	+ The mean flow remains in H-mode, while the zonal flow vanishes. Shear flow suppression of turbulence has been modeled, in which sheared flow amplifies the saturation mechanism in H-mode, which is called the nonlinear suppression model:
		$$\frac{\text{d}\mathcal{E}}{\text{d}t} \,=\, \gamma_1 \mathcal{E} - \alpha_{sat} \left(1 + \alpha_{sup} \left(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial x}\right)\right) \mathcal{E}^2$$

		+ The suppression rate coefficient is $\alpha_{sup}$ and the normalized radial electric field is $Z$. This nonlinear model is more robust compared to the linear one.

### 2.3 Plasma momentum

+ Internal drivers of momentum are the nonambipolar fluxes, while external momentum input is usually NBI.

	+ Viscous stress damps the flow across flux surfaces, but also charge exchange friction with neutrals at the edge adds to damping.

+ Momentum is a conserved variable that can be transported across flux surfaces to add a radial component to the plasma current. In steady-state, the radial ion force balance is:
	$$E_r \,=\, \frac{1}{n_i q_i} \nabla p_i v_\phi B_\theta - v_\theta B_\phi$$

	+ Often, the radial field is determined experimentally by measure 3 contributions:

		+ The poloidal and toroidal flow velocity can be measured using spectroscopy on radiating impurities assuming it represents the plasma flow velocity.

		+ The pressure gradient can be measured from density and temp measurements, but the error is amplified near the edge due to steep gradients.

	+ Another approach to measure $E_r$ requires the knowledge of the particle fluxes across magnetic flux surfaces. These fluxes can be classified as ambipolar and nonambipolar.

		+ Ambipolar fluxes are equal for electrons and ions, resulting in zero radial current.

		+ Nonambipolar $\Gamma^{na}$ are different for various species and may violate the ambipolarity constraint:
			$$\langle \mathbf{J}\cdot \nabla \rho \,=\, \sum_s q_s \Gamma_s^{na} \,=\, 0$$

		+ As a result, $E_r$ generates a return current such that the flux surface-averaged divergence of the plasma vanishes.

		+ Nonambipolar fluxes are also generated by kinetic and atomic processes.

### 2.4 Nonambipolar particle fluxes

+ The total nonambipolar particle flux $\Gamma^{na}$ is split into contributions from volumetric $\Gamma_V^{na}$ and edge $\Gamma_E^{na}$ processes.
