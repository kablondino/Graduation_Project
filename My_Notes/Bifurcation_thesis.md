## Notes on _Bifurcation Theory of the L-H Transition in Fusion Plasmas_
### L-H Transition

+ L-mode: turbulence enhances radial transport

+ H-mode: local reduction in transport (at edge)

	+ The edge therefore has an "edge transport barrier"

+ There is NO consensus on what plasma physics mechanism causes spontaneous transition from L-mode to H-mode

+ 3 different types of dynamics of transition are observed: sharp (sudden), oscillatory, and smooth

+ Bifurcation theory is the mathematical study of qualitative changes in the solutions of dynamical systems.
