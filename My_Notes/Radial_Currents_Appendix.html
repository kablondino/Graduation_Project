<!-- ------------ THE ABSTRACT ------------

    The response of a tokamak plasma to a time-dependent axisymmetric radial electric field is considered.
    The bounce-average motion of magnetically trapped ions is shown to consist of a radial drift, in addition to the well-known toroidal precession.
    This is a neoclassical polarization drift, which is larger than the standard one by a factor of B^2 / B_\theta^2, the square of the ratio of total to poloidal magnetic fields.
    The resulting low-frequency dielectric constant is larger than the standard one by approximately the same factor, when the ions are in the banana regime of neoclassical theory.

<p>There are several mechanisms which would set up [a quasi-electrostatic field], such as the loss of energetic ions or runaway electrons.</p>
<p>Time-dependent radial electric field in the context of momentum input from NBI. The plasma toroidal velocity is related to the radial electric field by: <span class="math">\[u_{\phi} \,=\, \frac{c E_r}{B_\theta}\]</span></p>
<p>Angular momentum input in the same direction as the plasma current (co-injection) results in an increasing radial electric field, while counter-injection results in a decreasing one.</p>
<p>Macroscopically, a radial current must flow in the plasma to provide the torque to change the plasma angular momentum, with the required value of the current density as (<span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> is mass density): <span class="math">\[\frac{j_r B_\theta}{c} \,=\, \rho \frac{\partial u_\phi}{\partial t}\]</span></p>
<p>This give a relationship between <span class="math">\(j_r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\dot{E_r}\)</span>, which <strong>is</strong> the neoclassical polarization current: <span class="math">\[j_r \,=\, \frac{\rho c^2}{B_\theta^2} \frac{\partial E_r}{\partial t}\]</span></p>

<!-- ------------ THE ABSTRACT ------------

    The mechanism for formation of a steep structure in the radial electric field is a key issue in plasma confinement.
    Properties of the radial electric field bifurcation are studied taking into account the effect of electrode biasing.
    The radial electric field structure is determined by the charge conservation equation.
    From the nonlinear mechanism associated with local current due to ion bulk viscosity, a transition can take place.
    Various types of radial electric field structures with multiple peaks are allowed for the same boundary condition.
    The ion orbit loss term breaks the symmetry of the radial current similarly to the ambipolar radial electric field.
    A radial current driven by the electrode plays the role of a control parameter in a transition similarly to the pressure gradient.
    A phase diagram is given in the spontaneous drive vs external drive space.
    Differences in the radial shape of solitary electric field structures are demonstrated in the presence of spatial varying components.
    This study clarifies the mechanisms of nonlinear structure formation in transport barriers.

<ul>
<li>&quot;In this paper, properties of the radial electric field transition between L-mode and H-mode are studied, taking into accout the effect of electrode biasing.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Electrode biasing is a method in controlling the radial electric field externally.</p>
<p>This model also includes neoclassical bulk viscosity and orbit losses as contributors. These two components have different dependencies on the radial electric field, and their competition gives structural bifurcation of the field.</p>
<ul>
<li>The radial electric field structure is determined by the charge conservation equation: <span class="math">\[\frac{\partial E_r}{\partial t} \,=\, -\frac{1}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_\perp} \left(J_\text{visc} + J_r + J_\text{other} - J_\text{ext}\right)\]</span> with <span class="math">\(\epsilon_\perp\)</span> as the dielectric constant of magnetized plasma, <span class="math">\(J_\text{visc}\)</span> is current driven by shear viscocity, <span class="math">\(J_r\)</span> is local current due to ion bulk viscosity, and <span class="math">\(J_\text{other}\)</span> encompassing other, such as orbit losses and charge exchange losses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The shear viscocity current can be written (with <span class="math">\(\mu_i\)</span> as the shear viscocity of ions) as: <span class="math">\[J_\text{visc} \,=\, -\epsilon_0\epsilon_\perp \nabla\cdot \mu_i \nabla E_r\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The charge conservation equation above can be normalized as the following: <span class="math">\[\frac{\partial^2 X}{\partial x^2} - (X - X_a) f(X,y) - g(X,y) + I = 0 \\
X \,=\, \frac{E_r}{v_{i,therm} B_\theta}, ~~~~~ y \,=\, \frac{r \nu_{ii} B}{v_{i,therm} B_\theta}, ~~~~~ I \,=\, \frac{J_\text{ext}}{v_{i,therm} B_\theta \sigma(0)}, \\
x \,=\, \frac{r - r_0}{l}, ~~~\text{and}~~~ l \,=\, \sqrt{\frac{\mu_i \epsilon_0 \epsilon_\perp}{\sigma(0)}}\]</span> <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is (another) normalized radial electric field, <span class="math">\(X_a\)</span> is the ambipolar radial electric field, <span class="math">\(\sigma(0)\)</span> is the conductivity for zero radial electric field, <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is the normalized collision frequency, <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is the normalized external current, and <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is the minor radius normalized by <span class="math">\(l\)</span>. <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span> is chosen to be the mid-point between the electrode and limiter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first term in the normalized DE corresponds to the shear viscocity and acts as a diffusion term.</p></li>
<li><p>The second term arises from <span class="math">\(J_r\)</span> and is given by the neoclassical ion particle flux.</p></li>
<li><p>The function <span class="math">\(f(X,y)\)</span> is the electrical conductivity, which is nonlinearly-dependent on the radial electric field.</p></li>
<li><p>The function <span class="math">\(g(X,y)\)</span> comes from <span class="math">\(J(\text{other})\)</span>, specifically ion orbit losses.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\(X_a\)</span> depends on the gradient of each plasma parameter. See Eq. (6). This term is used as the control parameter that describes the plasma.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The number of particles in the loss region gives the magnitude of the orbit loss term: <span class="math">\[g(X,y) \,=\, g_0(X,y) \,=\, A \frac{y}{\Pi} \, \exp\left(-\Pi\right) ~~~~~\text{with}~~~~\Pi \,\equiv\, \sqrt{\epsilon^{-3/2} y + (\alpha X)^4}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\alpha = 0.5\)</span> is the numerical constant that accounts for orbit shape, <span class="math">\(\epsilon = 0.33\)</span> is the inverse aspect ratio, and <span class="math">\(A = 3\)</span> is a constant that represents the ratio of the magnitude of the orbit loss term to the neoclassical term.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Two nonlinear terms affect the radial electric field in this case. The ion orbit loss term breaks the symmetry of the radial current similarly to the ambipolar radial electric field that depends on <span class="math">\(\nabla p\)</span>.</p>
<p>As <span class="math">\(\nabla p\)</span> increases, a spontaneous sharp transition takes place when the collision frequency is small and squeezing of the banana orbit is strong.</p>
<p>The radial electric field is negative when <span class="math">\(I = 0\)</span>. When there is current in the electrode, it acts like a <span class="math">\(\nabla p\)</span>. The threshold for transition by electrode biasing changes in accordance with <span class="math">\(\nabla p\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Previously, we assumed the ambipolar radial electric field term to be constant in space, so the DE had translational invariance in space. In reality, there is spatial variation in the plasma parameter that affect the structure of the radial electric field <strong>through</strong> the ambipolar radial electric field.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, the magnitude of the orbit loss terms depends on the spatial position (assume a simple form of exponential decay): <span class="math">\[g(X,y,x) \,=\, g_0(X,y) \, \exp\left[\left(-\frac{x - d}{\rho_p}\right)^2\right]\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>These (?) terms cause the nonlinear terms in the DE to vary in space, which produce other scale lengths.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fig. 4 shows the spatial profiles of the field with nonuniform ion density. Peaks of the field tend to shift to the larger density gradient region for positive biasing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>We introduce a spatial dependency on the ambipolar field: <span class="math">\[X_a \,=\, -\frac{p}{2d}(x + d)\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The ambipolar field varies linearly from zero at the electrode to <span class="math">\(p\)</span> at the position of the limiter, with <span class="math">\(p\)</span> representing the magnitude of the spatial variation of the ambipolar field.</p></li>
<li><p>Lines a, b, and c in Figs. 4 and 5 represent the peak positions of single, double, and triple peaked structure.</p></li>
<li><p>As <span class="math">\(p\)</span> increases, the peak of the single begins to shift outward first, and then the peaks of the double shift next. The peaks approach the outermost peak position of the triple for large values of <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The equation <strong>without</strong> spatial variance has translational invariance, and no energy is needed for parallel movement. The shape of the structure is not sensitive to the asymmetric term, but only a small nonuniformity gives a significant change in the peak position.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The selection rule (?) shows that the structure with 1 peak is formed after a transition, but this sensitivity of its position to spatial gradients indicates that the single peak appears at the peak position of the structure with the maximum number of peaks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The max number of available peaks is determined by the distance between the electrode and the limiter, so a measurement of the peak position gives info on the scale of the normalizing distance <span class="math">\(l\)</span> and on the viscosity <span class="math">\(\mu_i\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It is then discussed how the peak shift is logarithmically dependent on <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and shows the form, in which the solution is simply a small translation <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span> added to the old, homogenous solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They considered neoclassical bulk viscosity, ion orbit losses, anomalous transport, and electrode current to be the dominant contributors to the radial current, and the nonlinear responses of the former 2 terms to the radial electric field give various structures with multiple peaks for the same boundary condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Claim</strong>: the competition between two nonlinear terms (neoclassical bulk viscosity and ion orbit losses) explains the H-mode transition mechanism and an asymmetric bifurcation feature with respect to the electrode current term.</p></li>
<li><p>The shape of the radial electric field structure is not sensitive to the spatially asymmetric term and the properties of the basic nonlinearity persist; however, a small spatial variation can cause a large shift of the peak position.</p></li>
<li><p>Electrode biasing can be used to make wider and stronger transport barriers.</p></li>
