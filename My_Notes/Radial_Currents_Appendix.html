<!-- ------------ THE ABSTRACT ------------

    The response of a tokamak plasma to a time-dependent axisymmetric radial electric field is considered.
    The bounce-average motion of magnetically trapped ions is shown to consist of a radial drift, in addition to the well-known toroidal precession.
    This is a neoclassical polarization drift, which is larger than the standard one by a factor of B^2 / B_\theta^2, the square of the ratio of total to poloidal magnetic fields.
    The resulting low-frequency dielectric constant is larger than the standard one by approximately the same factor, when the ions are in the banana regime of neoclassical theory.

<p>There are several mechanisms which would set up [a quasi-electrostatic field], such as the loss of energetic ions or runaway electrons.</p>
<p>Time-dependent radial electric field in the context of momentum input from NBI. The plasma toroidal velocity is related to the radial electric field by: <span class="math">\[u_{\phi} \,=\, \frac{c E_r}{B_\theta}\]</span></p>
<p>Angular momentum input in the same direction as the plasma current (co-injection) results in an increasing radial electric field, while counter-injection results in a decreasing one.</p>
<p>Macroscopically, a radial current must flow in the plasma to provide the torque to change the plasma angular momentum, with the required value of the current density as (<span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> is mass density): <span class="math">\[\frac{j_r B_\theta}{c} \,=\, \rho \frac{\partial u_\phi}{\partial t}\]</span></p>
<p>This give a relationship between <span class="math">\(j_r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\dot{E_r}\)</span>, which <strong>is</strong> the neoclassical polarization current: <span class="math">\[j_r \,=\, \frac{\rho c^2}{B_\theta^2} \frac{\partial E_r}{\partial t}\]</span></p>
<p>It is argued that both trapped and free (untrapped) particles participate with the same radial drift velocity.</p>
