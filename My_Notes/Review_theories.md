# Notes on _A Review of Theories of the L-H Transition_ by J.W. Connor and H.R. Wilson
## 1. Introduction

+ ASDEX found an empirical law for the heating required for H-mode (with some nuance):
	$$P_{h} \,=\, 0.04 \, \bar{n}_e \, B \, S$$

	+ Above, in MW, with $\bar{n_e}$ as the line-averaged electron density in units of $10^{20}$ m$^{-3}$, $B$ as the magnetic field strength, and $S$ as the plasma surface area.

+ L-H transition requires less heating when the magnetic field config. is such that the ion-$\nabla B$ drift direction is towards a single null formed by the divertor geometry, rather than away from it.
