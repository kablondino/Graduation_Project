\chapter{Dynamical Model}\label{chapter:dynamical_model}
Fusion plasmas are inherently complicated systems, and thus are complicated to model, even when taking simplification liberties.
The model developed by Itoh \emph{et al.} \cite{itoh_edge_1991} and Zohm \cite{zohm_dynamic_1994}, and later refined by others, assumes that the transport barrier occurs in a thin layer at the plasma edge.
The plasma edge is defined to be at the last-closed flux surface (separatrix).
This allows for slab geometry to be used, in which $\psi$ is a usual radial coordinate.
However, $x$ will be used as it is more distinct as a spatial coordinate.
The slab geometry reduces the model into a system of one (spatial) dimensional partial differential equations.
The domain of the model is $0 \,\leq\, x \,\leq\, L$, in which $x = 0$ is the plasma outer edge, and $x = L$ is some depth towards the core.

\section{Transport Equations}\label{sec:transport_eqs}
To model the transport of a fully-ionized fusion plasma, conservation of mass and energy are considered.
These lead to continuity equations of plasma density $n$ and internal energy $U$
\begin{align} % n and U continuity
	\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} \,+\, \frac{\partial \Gamma}{\partial x} \,&=\, 0~,\label{eq:n_continuity} \\
	\frac{\partial U}{\partial t} \,+\, \frac{\partial q}{\partial x} \,&=\, 0\label{eq:U_continuity}~.
\end{align}
The particle flux $\Gamma$ is determined by some effective particle diffusion $D$ due to anomalous transport.
Note that $\Gamma$ here refers to all species of particle fluxes, both ambipolar and nonambipolar.
The heat flux $q$, however, is determined by effective heat convection.
This is the sum of heat diffusion $\chi n T^\prime$, and advection $\Gamma T$.
\begin{align} % Fluxes
	\Gamma \,&=\, -D \frac{\partial n}{\partial x}~,\label{eq:particle_flux} \\
	q \,&=\, -\chi n \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \,+\, \frac{\Gamma T}{\gamma - 1} \label{eq:heat_flux}
\end{align}
The adiabatic index $\gamma$ will be set to $5/3$, as is customary for monatomic gases.
It is important to note that these fluxes omit explicit drift velocities as well as particle and heat sources from within the domain of the model \cite{zohm_dynamic_1994}.

The particle and heat diffusivities $D$ and $\chi$ are considered to be functions of the turbulence.
The L-H transition is not expected to be caused by a difference in form between the two diffusivities.
It is therefore assumed they are proportional
\begin{align} % chi-D relation
	\chi \,=\, \frac{D}{\zeta (\gamma - 1)} \label{eq:heat_particle_diff_relation}~.
\end{align}
The parameter $\zeta$ determines the coupling strength of the two diffusivities. The specifics of the forms chosen for the diffusivities is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:diffusivities}.

In order to simplify the model, substituting the following definition of the internal energy should be made.
\begin{align} % U definition
	U \,\equiv\, \frac{n T}{\gamma - 1} \label{eq:U_definition}
\end{align}
In addition, one of the liberties taken to simplify the model is that a single temperature is used, \emph{i.e.} the electron and ion temperatures are assumed identical.
Making this substitution, along with the particle and heat fluxes, we can arrive at relegated forms of Equations~\ref{eq:n_continuity} and \ref{eq:U_continuity}.

\begin{align} % Compact transport equations
	\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} \,&=\, \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[D \,
		\frac{\partial n}{\partial x}\right]~,\label{eq:n_compact} \\
	\frac{\partial(n\,T)}{\partial t} \,&=\, \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
		\left[\frac{D\,n}{\zeta} \, \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right]
		\,+\, \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
		\left[D\,T \, \frac{\partial n}{\partial x}\right]~. \label{eq:U_compact}
\end{align}

The product rules of the derivatives can subsequently be worked out to obtain a further-reduced form.
One convenience is that Equation~\ref{eq:n_continuity} shows up as a collection of terms within Equation \ref{eq:U_compact}.
This allows those terms to vanish:
\begin{align} % More reduced temperature equation
	\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \,&=\, \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[\frac{D}{\zeta} 
		\, \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right] \,+\,
		\left(1 + \frac{1}{\zeta}\right) \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} \,
		\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}~. \label{eq:T_compact}
\end{align}

\section{Nonambipolar Particle Fluxes}\label{sec:nonambipolar_fluxes}
As described in Section~\ref{ssec:E_r}, the dynamics of the radial electric field will be determined by investigating the various nonambipolar fluxes.
The fluxes chosen for this analysis comes from a compilation by Callen \cite{callen_toroidal_2009}, Itoh and Itoh \cite{itoh_role_1996}, and Stringer \cite{stringer_explanation_1993}. \todo{\color{red}Needed??}

\subsection{Polarization Current}\label{ssec:polarization_current}
In Maxwell's correction of Amp\`ere's law, a polarization current is induced whenever the time derivative of an electric field is non-zero.
This is from the changing state of polarization.
\begin{align} % Polarization current
	J_\text{pol} \,=\, \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0\,\mu_0 \, B_\theta^2} \, \frac{\partial E_r}{\partial t}
		\,=\, \frac{\sum_j m_j n_j}{B_\theta^2} \, \frac{\partial E_r}{\partial t}
		\label{eq:polarization_current_original}
\end{align}
This is larger than the classical polarization by a factor of $B^2 / B_\theta^2$ \cite{hinton_neoclassical_1984}.

\subsection{Shear Viscosity}\label{ssec:shear_viscosity}
The ion shear (perpendicular) viscosity is the perpendicular component of the viscous stress tensor.
In the L--H transition, it can be viewed as coupling the L-- and H--mode solutions spatially.
It can be expressed as 

\subsection{Bulk Viscosity}\label{ssec:bulk_viscosity}
Two mathematical forms of the parallel ion (bulk) viscosity have been developed in the literature.
One by Shaing and Crume \cite{shaing_bifurcation_1990} involves

\begin{align}% Shaing Bulk Viscosity
	\langle \mathbf{B}_\theta \cdot \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\pi} \rangle \,=\,
		\frac{\epsilon^2 \sqrt{\pi}}{4 x} \, n\,m_i\,v_{T_i}\,B
		\left(I_\theta U_\theta \,+\, I_\phi U_{\theta 0}\right)
		\label{eq:shaing_bulk}
\end{align}
Here, $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ is the ion viscosity tensor, and $U_\theta$ and $U_{\theta 0}$ indicate poloidal flow velocities.
The terms $I_\phi$ and $I_\theta$ represent large poloidal and toroidal integrals, respectively, which are quite taxing to compute.

However, in an effort to circumvent the direct calculations of flow velocities, a different form is used in this investigation, introduced by Stringer \cite{stringer_explanation_1993}.
\begin{align} % Stringer Bulk Viscosity
	\Gamma_i^{\pi\parallel} \,=\, \,n_e\,&D_{\pi\parallel}
		\left(\frac{n^\prime}{n} + \frac{Z}{\rho_{\theta i}}\right) \,
		\text{Im}\left[X\left(Z + i\,\frac{\nu_{ii}}{\omega_t}\right)\right]
		\label{eq:stringer_Gamma_bulk} \\
	&D_{\pi\parallel} \,=\, \frac{\epsilon^2\,\rho_{\theta i}\,T}
		{(x - a_m)\sqrt{\pi}\,B} \label{eq:stringer_D_bulk}
\end{align}
The complex function $X(z)$ is referred to as the plasma dispersion function.
It appears in the dispersion equation for linearized waves in a non-relativistic plasma when the velocity distribution is Maxwellian \cite{fried_plasma_2015}.
\begin{align} % Plasma Dispersion Function
	X(z) \,\equiv\, i\,\sqrt{\pi} \, e^{-z^2} \, \text{erfc}(-i\,z) \,=\,
		\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{e^{-t^2}}{t - z}
		\, \text{d}t \label{eq:plasma_disp}
\end{align}
\emph{Note} that function is usually denoted as $Z$, but I am breaking this standard notation to avoid ambiguity with the normalized radial electric field.

\subsection{Electron Anomalous Diffusion}\label{ssec:an_diffusion}
Turbulence affects ions and electrons differently, which can cause a nonambipolar flux.
In particular, when a drift wave turbulence interacts with the edge of plasma, it preferentially removes electron momentum across the last-closed flux surface \cite{itoh_model_1988}.
The particle flux for this effect can be written as
\begin{align} % Gamma_an original and D_an
	\Gamma_e^\text{an} \,=\, -n_e \, &D^\text{an} \left(\frac{n^\prime}{n} \,+\,
		\frac{\alpha_\text{an}\,T_e^\prime}{T_e} \,+\, \frac{e\,E_r}{T_e}\right)
		\label{eq:Gamma_an_orig} \\
	&D_\text{an} \,=\, \frac{\epsilon^2 \sqrt{\pi}}{2 a_m}
		\frac{\rho_{\theta e} \, T_e}{B} \label{eq:D_an}
\end{align}
The numerical constant $\alpha_\text{an}$ is on the order of unity, and $D_\text{an}$ is the diffusion coefficient for this process.
We can normalize the electric field, rewrite the terms with gradient coefficients $g_l^\text{k}$.
\begin{align} % Gamma_an g's
	e\,\Gamma_e^\text{an} \,&=\, g_n^\text{an}\,\frac{n^\prime}{n} \,+\,
		g_T^\text{an}\,\frac{T^\prime}{T} \,+\,
		g_Z^\text{an}\,Z \label{eq:Gamma_an_g} \\
	g_n^\text{an} \,=\, -e \, n \, &D_\text{an}~,~~~~
		g_T^\text{an} \,=\, \alpha_\text{an} \, g_n^\text{an}~,~~~~
		g_Z^\text{an} \,=\, \frac{g_n^\text{an}}{\rho_{\theta i}}
		\label{eq:g_an}
\end{align}

\subsection{Charge Exchange Friction}\label{ssec:cx_friction}
\begin{align}
	\langle \sigma v\rangle_\text{cx} \,=\, \frac{C_\text{cx}}{\sqrt{m_i}} \,
		\exp\left[-\frac{13.6~\text{eV}}{T}\right] \label{eq:cx_rate}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	e\,\Gamma_e^\text{cx} \,&=\, g_n^\text{cx}\,\frac{n^\prime}{n} \,+\,
		g_T^\text{cx}\,\frac{T^\prime}{T} \,+\,
		g_Z^\text{cx}\,Z \label{eq:Gamma_cx_g} \\
	g_n^\text{cx} \,=\, -\frac{m_i \,n_0 \langle\sigma v\rangle_\text{cx} \,n T}
		{B_\theta^2}& \left[\frac{B_\theta^2}{\epsilon^2 B_\phi^2} + 2\right]
		~,~~~~ g_T^\text{cx} \,=\, \alpha^\text{cx}\,g_n^\text{cx}~,~~~~
		g_Z^\text{cx} \,=\, -\frac{g_n^\text{cx}}{\rho_{\theta i}}
		\label{eq:g_cx}
\end{align}

\subsection{Ion Orbit Loss}\label{ssec:ol_loss}
\begin{align}
	\Gamma_i^\text{OL} \,=\, n\, \nu_\text{eff} \sqrt{\epsilon}\,\rho_{\theta i}\,
		\frac{\exp\left[-\sqrt{\nu_{*i} + Z^4 + \left(\frac{x}{w_{bi}}\right)^4}\right]}
		{\sqrt{\nu_{*i} + Z^4 + \left(\frac{x}{w_{bi}}\right)^4}}
\end{align}

\section{Radial Electric Field Equation}\label{sec:Z_equation}
A rigorous theory on what causes the diffusion coefficients $D$ and $\chi$ is still unknown.
%However, experiments and mathematical investigations indicate that flows in the plasma can tear apart turbulent eddies, which reduces the transport radially.\todo{\color{red}{Reword?}}
To model the dynamics of the transition fully within this scope, the radial electric field must also be evolved explicitly.
As shown previously, the radial electric field $E_r$ is normalized with the ion poloidal gyroradius $\rho_\theta$ into $Z$ for this investigation, shown in Equation~\ref{eq:Z_and_rho_definitions}.

Itoh \emph{et al.}, originally modeled an evolution to the radial electric field, which included hysteresis and an oscillatory phase \cite{itoh_edge_1991}
\begin{align} % Original Itoh model
	\frac{\partial Z}{\partial t} \,&=\, -N(Z,g) + \mu \frac{\partial Z^2}{\partial x^2}~,\label{eq:original_z} \\
	N(Z,g) \,&\equiv\, g - g_0 + \left[\beta Z^3 - \alpha Z\right]~.
\end{align}
The nonlinear $N(Z,g)$ function introduces the bifurcating behavior, with $g$ acting as a gradient parameter, and $g_0$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ as the bifurcation parameters \cite{itoh_model_1988}.
Paquay rewrote the equation as
\begin{align} % Modern model
	\epsilon \, \frac{\partial Z}{\partial t} \,=\, \mu \, \frac{\partial^2 Z}{\partial x^2} \,+\,
		\frac{c_n T}{n^2} \, \frac{\partial n}{\partial x} \,+\,
		\frac{c_T}{n} \, \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \,+\, G(Z)~,\label{eq:paquay_Z} \\
	G(Z) \,\equiv\, a + bZ + cZ^3 \label{eq:G_polynomial}
\end{align}
\todo{\color{red}Move and expand}

\section{Forms of Diffusivities}\label{sec:diffusivities}
Various forms of $D$ (and subsequently $\chi$) are presented in investigations with this model.
The original Itoh model has $D$ proportional to the hyperbolic tangent of the normalized radial electric field \cite{itoh_edge_1991, zohm_dynamic_1994}
\begin{align} % Itoh diffusivity
	D(Z) \,&=\, \frac{D_\text{max} + D_\text{min}}{2} +
		\frac{(D_\text{max} - D_\text{min})\tanh(Z)}{2}~. \label{eq:Itoh_diffusivity}
\end{align}

However, it is now accepted that the diffusivity must be a function of the shear of the field.
This is either due to the stabilization of linear modes, or through the reduction of turbulence amplitudes, correlation lengths, or change in phases of the fluctuations \cite{connor_review_2000}.
It was found that ``a flattened (steep) radial equilibrium gradient tends to enhance (eliminate) turbulence suppression due to the shear flow'' \cite{zhang_edge_1992}.
\begin{align} % Shear diffusivity
	D(Z^{\prime}) \,=\, \frac{D_\text{min}}{1 + c(Z^{\prime})^{\gamma}} \label{eq:shear_diffusivity}
\end{align}
Staps uses this form, with $c = 0.5$ and $\gamma = 2$ \cite{staps_backstepping_2017}.
Another form includes both the field itself and its shear \cite{paquay_studying_2012}
\begin{align} % Flow-Shear equation
	D(Z, Z^{\prime}) \,=\, D_\text{min} \,+\, \frac{D_\text{max} - D_\text{min}}{1 + a_1 Z^2 + a_2 Z \cdot Z^{\prime} + a_3 (Z^{\prime})^2} \label{eq:flow-shear}
\end{align}

\section{Boundary Conditions}\label{sec:boundary_conditions}
The set of aforementioned PDE's is evaluated in a domain that is small enough to exclude the inner (core) boundary from any possible particle and heat sources.
In this model, this boundary to the domain is $x = L$, for some positive length $L$, with the core is assumed to be at $x \gg L$.
It also requires the domain to be sufficiently large to fully-encompass the transport barrier and ignore any possible boundary effects of the barrier itself.
The outer boundary of the plasma edge is assumed to be the SOL (scrape-off layer).
This corresponds to $x = 0$.

It is assumed that the SOL is passive to particle and heat fluxes, and therefore the density and temperature profiles exponentially decay.
\begin{align} % n and T boundary conditions at SOL
	n^\prime(0) \,=\, \frac{n}{\lambda_n}~, ~~~~
		T^\prime(0) \,=\, \frac{T}{\lambda_T}~.\label{eq:nT_SOL_boundary}
\end{align}
The core side has a constant influx of particles and heat, stemming from fueling and heating.
\begin{align} % Fluxes from core
	\Gamma(L) \,&=\, \Gamma_c ~\longrightarrow~ n^\prime(L)
		\,=\, \frac{\Gamma_c}{D} \label{eq:core_particle_flux}\\
	q(L) \,&=\, q_c ~\longrightarrow~ T^\prime(L) \,=\, \frac{\zeta(
		\Gamma_c \, T - (\gamma - 1)\,q_c)}{D \, n} \label{eq:core_heat_flux}
\end{align}
There are hypothesized boundary conditions for the electric field at the core, but are not confirmed in any way.
